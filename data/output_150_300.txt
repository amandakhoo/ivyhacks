To investigate the role of light in adventitious root initiation (ARI) in Norway spruce, we used de-rooted Norway spruce seedlings as a model system. Three-week-old seedlings grown under white light condition were harvested and de-rooted as described in Materials and
Methods (
). They were first kept in hormone free (HF) distilled water, under three different white light (WL) regimes as described in Materials and
Methods (irradiance 69 to 75 µM/m2/s−1; 
). In these conditions no AR developed at the base of the hypocotyls regardless of the photoperiod or the source of white light. Since we obtained the same results in all WL conditions, we continued to use constant WL (cWL) provided by LEDs (
) as control conditions for the rest of the study.

From January 2018 to August 2019, we prospectively enrolled patients who were scheduled to have a revision surgery for indications of chronic infection of knee and hip arthroplasties or aseptic loosening of an implant. The patients were divided into two groups, ‘aseptic revision’ and ‘infection’, based on the 2013 Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria for the diagnosis of PJI. Aseptic revision cases were defined as cases undergoing single-stage revision for a diagnosis other than infection (loosening, wear, instability, malalignment, adverse local tissue reactions, or other aseptic causes). A postoperative infection was considered ‘chronic’ when PJI symptoms occurred for more than six weeks after implantation. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board and patients signed an informed consent form prior to their enrolment in the study. To rule out interference with other inflammatory markers, patients with the following conditions were excluded: inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout; infectious disease such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection; malignancy; and patients with recent antibiotic use (less than two weeks). We included a total of 93 patients into our prospective cohort study (there were originally 101 cases, but eight cases were excluded because of ‘dry tap’), among which 37 patients met MSIS criteria for chronic PJI. The patients’ demographics and details were shown in Table I. We recorded the patients’ following baseline data: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), the involved joint, and time since prosthesis implantation. Blood samples were taken from the cubital vein on admission and analyzed for serum IL-6, ESR, and CRP. Synovial fluid was obtained before revision surgery for synovial fluid IL-6 (SF IL-6), percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN%) analysis, synovial white blood cell count, and cultures. During the revision arthroplasty, we obtained at least three tissue samples from the patients for microbiological culture. Those tissue samples were cultured for 24 to 48 hours (standard culture) and 14 days (prolonged culture). Biochemical assays were performed at the biochemistry laboratory of the biology technical platform. All those samples including blood, synovial fluid, and tissue were separated into two groups: group I, patients with PJI diagnosed by MSIS criteria; and group II, patients with aseptic loosening of prothesis. Demographic data for the study population. Variables are expressed as means (SDs) or absolute numbers and percentages. Independent-samples t-test. Fisher’s exact test. Statistically significant. BMI, body mass index Synovial fluid (1 ml to 2 ml) and serum samples were obtained soon after admission. The samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for ten minutes within two hours after collection to remove all cellular and particulate content. The levels of IL-6 in the synovial fluid and serum were determined by using the IMMUNOLITE 1000 Immunoassay System (SIEMENS Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The CRP was tested using a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay with a HITACHI 7600 Series Automatic Biochemical Analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and diagnostic kit (DiaSys Diagnostic Systems GmbH, Shanghai, China). The data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). The results of the diagnostic tests were compared between the groups using an independent-samples t-test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for IL-6 and PMN% in the synovial fluid and serum; CRP and ESR were used to establish optimal cut-off values as a diagnostic of PJI determined using Youden’s J statistic. They also allowed the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) with MedCalc 13.2.2 Software (MedCalc Software bv, Ostend, Belgium). The SPSS software version 24.0 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) was used for statistical analysis. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

S. suberectus plants were grown in Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants (22°51’28” N, 108°22’2” E). Plant tissues, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits from 8-years-old plants were collected. Each plant tissue had three biological repetitions. Each sample was randomly collected from five plants and divided into three groups for different purposes: quick-frozen samples, used for RNA isolation; dried samples, used for total flavonoid content determination; and freeze-dried samples, used for bioactive compounds content measurement. Comparative analysis was performed to identify orthologous gene families among the eight plant species as described in the main text including S. suberectus. For all-against-all proteins blast, we first filter the proteins with length less than 50 amino acids and retained the longest protein with alternative splicing variations, then using the BLASTP (E value < le−7) to blast the filtered proteins and clustered into orthologous groups using OrthoMCL with the inflation parameter at 1.5 (Li et al., 2003). One protein per species in a cluster was clustered into the single-copy orthologues, which were used for MUSCLE alignment and generated the phylogenetic tree via the maximum likelihood method (Edgar, 2004). The divergence time of each species was generated via the PAML MCMCtree (http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html) with the two corrected divergence time point, A. thaliana
vs. G. max: 97~109 Mya; A. thaliana
vs. Salvia miltiorrhiza: 110~124 Mya, from the TimeTree (http://http://www.timetree.org). The gene families’ expansion or contraction analysis were conducted by the CAFÉ software. The whole genome duplication (WGD) analysis was performed by the MCscanX software with default parameters. Three technical replicates for each sample and prepared for RNA isolation and transcriptome library construction. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol® Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, while the RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA). The raw data were then filtered according the standard quality control (QC) method. The retained pared end reads were then mapped to the S. suberectus reference genome using HISAT2 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml). The total numbers of aligned reads were normalized by gene length and sequencing depth for an accurate estimation of expression level and then used the Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) to represent the expression level of each gene for further calculation of the differential expression gene (DEG) using Deseq2 software (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html). We used these normalized read counts (RPKM) as the expression level for each gene. Based on log10 (RPKM+1) values, we used the R software (version 3.3.1) to plot the heatmap graph with package heatmap. In order to detect the candidate genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in the Leguminosae species, including S. suberectus, G. max, L. japonicus, G. uralensis, C. arietinum. The similarity calculated by BLASTP searching (e-value <= 1e−5) with known members from the model species G. max and A. thaliana and other reported plants, we have searched 15 genes involved in flavonoid synthesis in the above genome, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H, a CYP450 gene) and 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL), the first three enzymes in phenylpropanoid pathway (Saito et al., 2013), and others enzymes in this pathway including chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI) (Saslowsky and Winkel-Shirley, 2001), isoflavone synthase (IFS, a CYP450 gene), 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID) (Jung et al., 2000; Shimamura et al., 2007), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H, a 2-OGD gene) (Pelletier and Shirley, 1996), flavanone-3’-hydroxylase (F3’H, a CYP450 gene) (Schoenbohm et al., 2000), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) (Shirley et al., 1992), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS, alias LDOX, a 2-OGD gene) (Bowerman et al., 2012), anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) (Devic et al., 1999), flavonol synthase (FLS, a 2-OGD gene) (Pelletier et al., 1997), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) (Tanner et al., 2003), O-methyltransferase (OMT) (Hashim et al., 1990; Dhaubhadel et al., 2003; Li et al., 2016), and chalcone reductase (CHR, alias PKR, also named PKR) (Shimada et al., 2005). Because the homology of different genes is different, we choose different Identity thresholds. PAL, 4CL, CHS, CHI, HID, LAR, OMT, and ANR identity>=45; ANS, FLS, F3H (belonging to 2-OGD), C4H, F3’H (belonging to CYP450), DFR, CHR (belonging to reductase) identity>=65. Because of the IFS gene were treated as repeat sequences be masked, the pipeline determined IFS protein sequences from the originally predicted coding sequence by gene wise with protein sequences of G. max as reference, combine with the AUGUSTUS software to predict the structure. For phylogenetic analyses, the total IFS proteins from five Leguminosae plants (including S. suberectus, G. max, L. japonicus, G. uralensis, and C. arietinum) were subject to do multiple alignments using MUSCLE. Neighbor-joining tree was built using TreeBeST with the Jones–Taylor–Thornton (JTT) model and 100 bootstrap replicates using results of multiple alignments. We analyzed structure of the IFS genes among five Leguminosae plants and investigated the position relationship between the repetitive element and the IFS genes. Determination of total flavonoid content (TFC): The TFC was carried out according to Chen et al. (2016). Dry samples (0.3 g) and sonicated in 25 ml of 50% ethanol at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) for 1 h using a SB-800 DTD sonicator (Ningbo Xinzhi Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Ningbo, China; power: 100 W; frequency: 40 kHz). In this method, rutin was used as standard and flavonoid contents were measured as rutin equivalent. For this purpose, the calibration curve of rutin was drawn. One milliliter of standard or extract solution (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 ml) was taken into 25 ml volumetric flask, and 1 ml of 5% NaNO2 added to the flask. After 5 min, 1 ml 10% AlNO3 was added to the mixture. At the 5th min add 10 ml of 4% NaOH was added and volume made up to 25 ml with 50% ethanol. The absorbance was noted at 505 nm using UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Each standard compound was accurately weighed, and then dissolved in methanol–water (80:20, v/v) solvent to a final diluted stock solutions of 100 μg/ml. Working standard solutions containing five reference standards were prepared by diluting the stock solutions with methanol–water (80:20, v/v) solvent to produce the standard curves. The solutions were stored at 4°C for further analysis. All the freeze-dried samples were cut into smaller pieces, further grounded into powder. Each sample powder (0.05 g) was weighed accurately soaked in 1.2 ml of extracting solution (80% methanol with 0.01 mol/L butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and 0.1% formic acid). The mixture was vortexed for 10 s and ground for 2 min, followed by ultrasonic extraction for 2 h and centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitation was extracted again with ultrasonic and centrifuging. All the supernatants were vacuum freeze-dried and then diluted with 100 µl 80% methanol for UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analyses were performed using a Waters Acquity Ultraperformance Liquid Chromatography system (Milford, USA), equipped with a binary pump system (Waters). The UPLC analyses were performed using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm×2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm particle size) (Waters) with a binary mobile phase. Solvent A was methyl alcohol and B was water with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient elution was as follows: 0–1.5 min, 35–75% (v/v) A; 1.5–6 min, 75–95% (v/v) A; and 6–8 min, 95% (v/v) A; 8–8.1 min, 95-35% (v/v) A; 8.1–10 min, 35% (v/v) A. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min and the sample volume injected was 5 μl. The UPLC system was coupled to the API4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, USA.) using a Z-spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The data were acquired in MRM mode with ion spray voltage: 4.5 kV, curtain gas (nitrogen): 35 psi, ion source gas 1: 30 psi, ion source gas 2: 45 psi, turbo gas temperature: 550°C. Samples were examined using multiple reactant monitoring with the (m/z) precursor/product ion information in 
. Peak integration on the major isomer was performed using Analyst 1.6.2 software (Applied Biosystems, USA). Hierarchical cluster analyses were separately performed for the PC genes [mean fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) ≥ 2] using the OmicShare tools (www.omicshare.com/tools). WGCNA (v1.47) was used to construct the unsigned co-expression networks based on the transcript expression matrix. A step-by-step network construction and module detection method were adopted using the “cutreeDynamic” and “mergeCloseModules” with the following parameters: the power was 13; the minModuleSize was 30; the cutHeight was 0.25. We investigated the relationships between the transcripts in the modules and the samples, and the important modules that were significantly associated with the content of flavonoid, formononetin, isoliquiritigenin, genistein, and catechin. To understand the biological functions of the modules, the genes in the modules were subjected to GO enrichment analysis. Finally, the co-expression network was visualized by Cytoscape (v3.5.0) software. One-hybrid system in YM4271 yeast strain was used to test the binding ability of MYBs to the promoter of DFR, LAR, IFSs. Promoter fragments were inserted into pLacZi as reporters. MYBs were expressed in the yeast cells with pGADT7-AD. Total DNA was isolated from fresh young leaves of 8-year-old S. suberectus using the Plant DNA Kit (TIANGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extraction of messenger RNA (mRNA) was performed with the Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Long-distance PCR (LD-PCR) was executed by the PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (SMART). The promoters cloned from the DNA template and the full-length cDNA of two MYBs were cloned from the cDNA library. All the detail of these sequences were provided in the

We reviewed the relevant literature on PubMed and Web of Science that had been published between January 2000 and May 2020. We identified 599 studies addressing aberrant DNA methylation and genetic mutation in meningiomas. The words we searched included “meningioma,” “methylation,” and “gene mutation.” After analyzing all relevant articles, we found genes-of-interest and searched those genes on PubMed and Web of Science to acquire pertinent information.
The Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study. All consecutive cases of patients with HCC who were older than 18 years of age and treated between 2013 and 2015 at Winship Cancer Institute/Emory University Hospital system were identified and enrolled. All the patients (n = 28) who were included in the study had active HCC (Table 2). HCC patient characteristics. Paraffin embedded tissue blocks from HCC patients were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to ensure that the tissue slices subjected to RNA analysis have adequate (minimum 30–40%) tumor volume. % Tumor volume and % leukocytes in tissue sections are given in Table 2. High Pure FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) RNA Micro Kit was used to isolate RNA from the dissected paraffin slices according to the manufacturer instructions (Roche GmbH, Germany). Hundred to five-hundred nanogram of isolated RNA was used for total cDNA preparation (QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit, Qiagen, USA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Fluidigm 48 × 48 nanofluidic arrays. Briefly, cDNA samples were pre amplified with 14-cycle PCR reaction for each sample with the combination of 100 ng cDNA and pooled primers as described by TaqMan Pre-Amp Mastermix (Fluidigm BioMark™) manufacturer's protocols. Two thousand three hundred four parallel qRT-PCR reactions were performed for each primer pair on each sample on a 48 × 48 chip array. Human cDNA library was used as a positive control. Amplification was detected in Eva Green detection assay on a Biomark I machine based on standard Fluidigm protocols as described previously (34, 35). Two independent primer pairs were used for each target (Table 3). Cycle of Threshold (CT) values were normalized based on the endogenous GAPDH & beta actin controls. CT value of each target was subtracted with the CT value of endogenous GAPDH & beta actin (Control CT values) of the respective samples to get delta CT values. The delta CT values were subjected to a second standardization by adding all the delta CT values with a constant CT value, which was derived from the total average of control CT values from all the samples. In the case of Osteopontin or Glypican normalization, GAPDH & beta actin normalized CT values were further normalized with Osteopontin or Glypican-3. The normalized CT values are expressed as an inverse (CT−1) to better graphically represent the increase or decrease in expression as described previously (36). Inverse CT values were obtained by dividing 1 with the appropriate normalized CT value. High or low inverse CT values represent high or low expression of target genes, respectively. Primer sequences of the targets used in nanoscale chip PCR. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparin-anticoagulated whole blood using a Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradient (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Sweden), and cryopreserved in medium containing 90% fetal calf serum (HyClone) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Corning, USA). Prior to the experiment, cells were thawed and rested overnight in a 37°C CO2 incubator. For proliferation assays, Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Biolegend USA) labeled PBMC were stimulated for 4 days with plate bound 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Biolegend, USA) antibodies and 10ug/ml of PD-L1 Ig or Control Ig protein (Biolegend, USA) with varying concentrations of Kynurenine (Tocris, USA). Four days later, cells were stained with CD3-APCCy7 antibody (Biolegend, USA) and acquired in BD FACSAria instrument. Results were analyzed in Flow Jo software. Supernatants were analyzed for IFNγ using the kit, Human IFN gamma ELISA Ready-SET-Go according to the manufacture's instruction. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software for statistics. An unpaired two-sided t-test was used to determine significance between the means of two groups, and a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison tests was used to compare multiple groups simultaneously. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Linear regression analysis was performed using normalized CT values to obtain R2 and P-values. R2 = Goodness of Fit; P = Significance of the slope deviation from Zero. Correlations with R2 values above 0.5 with the P-value of < 0.05 were considered as the best correlation. Correlation with R2 values between 0.3 and 0.5 with the P-value of < 0.05 were considered as moderate correlations/statistical trend toward a correlation. Correlations with R2 values below 0.3 were considered relatively less significant.
A total of 107, largely geographically confined isolates, were identified for sequencing based on collection from different body sites and clinical matrices. All isolates were classified as A. baumannii based on orthogonal, clinical laboratory techniques. A description of all sequenced isolates is shown in Table S1. Samples were streaked from glycerol stocks onto Mueller Hinton (MH) (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Inoculated plates were checked for appropriate colony growth and morphology the following day prior to DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted from a single isolated colony for each sample using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the recommended protocol for Gram-negative bacteria. Sample DNA was fragmented using the QSonica q800 ultrasonic liquid processor (QSonica, Newtown, CT, USA). Sonication parameters were optimized to produce fragment sizes of 600–700 base pairs (time: 3 min, pulse: 15 s (Pulse On), 15 s (Pulse Off), amplitude: 20%). Libraries were size selected using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) in order to remove small and large fragments outside of the required size range. Genome libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Library Preparation Kit with Standard PCR Library Amplification (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using V3 sequencing chemistry (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). For MinION sequencing, DNA was extracted with the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO), taking care to limit DNA shearing. Long read sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore technologies on a MK1B MinION device using a R9.4 flow cell. The DNA library was prepared using the SQK-LSK109 Ligation Sequencing kit in conjunction with the PCR-Free Native Barcode Expansion kit following manufacturer's protocol (downloaded from https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/protocols/ on March 20, 2019) without the optional shearing steps to select for long reads. Illumina-derived whole genome sequence data was assembled with SPAdes v3.10 (48). Contigs that aligned against known contaminants or contained an anomalously low depth of coverage compared to the average depth of coverage on a per genome basis were manually removed. The MLST profiles were extracted from whole genome sequence (WGS) assemblies using BLAST-based methods (49) using both the Oxford (50) and Pasteur systems (51); novel alleles and sequence types were submitted to both databases. Annotation on all genomes was performed with Prokka v1.13 (52). Hybrid assemblies were generated with combined Illumina and MinION data with Unicycler v0.4.8-beta (53), which includes a polishing strep with Pilon v1.22 (54). Acinetobacter genome assemblies were downloaded from GenBank on March 13th, 2018. All genome assemblies were aligned against the A. baumannii genome AB307-2094 (CP001172.1) with NUCmer v3.1 (55) in conjunction with NASP v1.1.2 (56). SNPs that fell within duplicated regions, based on a reference self-alignment with NUCmer, were filtered from downstream analyses. For rapid evaluation, an approximate maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred on a concatenation of 1, 523, 968 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with FastTree v2.1.8 (57); SNPs were retained if they were conserved in >90% of all genomes. Antimicrobial resistance phenotypic profiles were identified for cefepime (FEP), cefuroxime (CXM), gentamicin (GEN), ceftazidime (CAZ), trimethoprim (TMP), azithromycin (AZM), ceftriaxone (CRO), aztreonam (ATM), erythromycin (ERY), piperacillin (PIP), levofloxacin (LVX), imipenem (IPM), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). A list of all drugs and resistance breakpoints used are shown in Table 1. Drugs were selected from published resistance patterns in the literature (58–60, 62–69). Samples were streaked from glycerol stocks onto Mueller Hinton (MH) (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. A single isolated colony was picked and inoculated into 10 mL of MH broth. Liquid cultures were incubated with shaking at 37°C overnight. The following morning, 100 μL of each overnight culture were transferred into 9.9 mL of fresh MH broth. Cultures were incubated with shaking at 37°C until optical density (OD600) measurements reached 0.5–0.8, indicating log phase growth. Fifty microliter of culture was inoculated onto new 15 × 150 mm MH agar plates and spread uniformly across the medium with a sterile cell spreader. Six different antimicrobial E-test strips (bioMérieux, France) were applied to the surface of the agar as directed by the manufacturer. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 16–18 h and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by visual inspection following the recommended manufacturer guidelines. For paired isolates, MIC tests were performed on different days. If the MIC was above CLSI guidelines for resistance, the strain was given an “R” (resistant) for that drug. If the MIC was below guidelines it was given an “S” (susceptible); if the MIC was between thresholds, it was given an “I” (intermediate). If biological replicates differed by more than one MIC dilution, the test was repeated. If replicates differed by a single MIC dilution, the lower MIC value was reported. Breakpoints of antimicrobials screened in this study. Enterobacteriaceae. Enterococcus. Once the confirmed set of A. baumannii were identified, a phylogeny was generated for 84 genomes. Raw WGS data were aligned against AB307-0294 with BWA-MEM v0.7.7 (70) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified with the UnifiedGenotyper method in GATK v3.3.1 (71, 72). SNPs that fell into duplicate regions of the reference, based on a NUCmer self-alignment, were removed from downstream analyses. All SNP calling methods were wrapped by the NASP pipeline. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred on a concatenation of 182,766 SNPs with IQ-TREE v1.6.1, using the TVMe + ASC + R5 model. Paired genomes were identified by low phylogenetic distance and variable MIC profiles (Table S2). All A. baumannii genomes (n = 3,218) were downloaded from the Assembly database in GenBank (73) on September 19th, 2018. Genomes were filtered if they: (1) contained >200 ambiguous nucleotides (n = 860); (2) contained >400 contigs (n = 189); (3) had a genome assembly size <3, 684, 234 or >4, 297, 137 (n = 51), or; (4) had an average MASH (74) distance >0.0252 (~97.5% average nucleotide identity) (n = 20). Genomes passing through all filters (n = 2183) were aligned against A. baumannii AB307-2094 (6) with NASP in conjunction with NUCmer. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred on a concatenation of 101,608 SNPs with IQ-TREE v1.6.1, using the TVM+F+ASC+R10 model, and rooted with an A. nosocomialis genome sequenced in this study (TG22170; RFEG00000000); the smaller number of SNPs is due to the reduced size of the core genome due to the inclusion of fragmented genome assemblies in GenBank. To identify coding region differences between paired isolates, the large-scale blast score ratio (LS-BSR) (75) tool was run on paired genomes in conjunction with BLAT (76). The order of genes between isolates was visualized with genoPlotR (77). The conservation of genes was compared between resistant and susceptible groups using a Mann-Whitney test implemented in Scipy v1.4.1 (78) and significance was applied at an alpha of 0.01. To identify genotype/phenotype associations, regions identified by LS-BSR were compared between resistant/susceptible phenotypes from each drug. Regions were first identified that had a blast score ratio (BSR) value (79) of >0.8 in one phenotype and a BSR value of <0.4 in the other phenotype. The BSR is calculated by dividing the query Blast bit score by the self-Blast bit score; a BSR value of 0.8 is equivalent to 80% identity over 100% of the alignment length. In addition to bulk differences in coding region sequences (CDSs), differences between individual SNPs and indels were identified through the analysis of Kmers. In this approach, the reverse complement was taken for all genome assemblies so that both strands were included in the analysis. All 21-mers were then identified with Ray-surveyor (80) and placed into a presence absence matrix; the choice of 21-mers was to ensure a short enough length to hopefully identify single mutations. The frequency of Kmers in each phenotype was then calculated with a custom Python script (https://gist.github.com/jasonsahl/e9516b2d940ad2474ba6e97f5b856440) and significance was assessed with a Mann-Whitney test implemented in Scipy with a Bonferroni p-value correction. In addition to these analyses, SNPs associated with resistance phenotypes were identified with default parameters in treeWAS v1.0 (81). From the raw sequence data, all possible 54-mers at a minimum frequency of 4 per genome were also processed with pyseer (82). A similarity matrix was generated with pyseer and included in the analysis to account for population structure. Pyseer was run using default settings, a similarity matrix, and a “maf” value of 0.40. Only Kmers with good chi-square values were included and were grouped by locus tag. Three machine learning models were tested within the scikit-learn python module (83): gradient boosting classification (GBC), random forest (RF), and penalized logistic regression (LR). Parameters were tuned for each model over 1,000 50–50% train-test splits. For each antimicrobial studied, all three models were analyzed on the same 500 replicates of 75–25% train-test split cross validation. Each iteration began with a random seed to ensure different train-test splits. To identify the conservation of previously characterized antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, we screened all genomes against proteins from the Comprehensive Antimicrobial Resistance Database (CARD) (31) with LS-BSR in conjunction with Diamond (84). Samples identified as paired isolates based on phylogenetic relatedness and differing AMR susceptibility profiles were streaked for isolation from glycerol stocks onto MH agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. For each sample a single colony was picked and inoculated into 10 mL of MH broth and incubated with shaking at 37°C overnight. The following morning 100 μL of each culture was inoculated into 9.9 mL of fresh media and OD600nm was monitored until cultures reached log phase growth OD600nm of ~0.5–0.8. Five-hundred microliter of each sample, as well as the susceptible control strain, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (ATCC 29213), were aliquoted into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Each sample was treated with sub-MIC concentrations of the designated antimicrobial, at one half of the previously recorded MIC value. Cultures were then incubated for 30 min with shaking at 37°C. Two volumes of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) were added to all samples and incubated at room temperature for 5 min, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at room temperature, at a speed of 5,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted and the treated cell pellets were stored at −80°C. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following recommended protocol #4 beginning at step 7 and continuing to protocol #7. A DNase I treatment was included for step 2 in protocol #7. Extracted RNA was immediately stored at −80°C. All mRNA extractions were performed in biological triplicate with cultures grown on separate days. RNA quality and quantity were checked by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the MICROBExpress kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated mRNA was quantified and checked for rRNA depletion on the bioanalyzer with an additional RNA Nano chip prior to sequencing. Previously isolated mRNA was prepared for transcriptome sequencing using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA, HT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the High Sample (HS) protocol. Prepared samples were quantified and checked for quality, then pooled in equimolar concentrations. Library pools were loaded into an Illumina High Output NextSeq 2 × 150bp kit, according to manufacturer recommendations for sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. The transcriptomes were assembled with metaSPAdes (85) using default settings. For targeted amplicon studies, complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated with the SuperScript IV VILO RT-PCR Master Mix with ezDNase enzyme (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), following manufacturer's recommendations. For each isolate pair, coding and intergenic regions identified with LS-BSR and prodigal were combined for complete genomes, then dereplicated with USEARCH v10 at an ID of 0.98. RNA-Seq reads were aligned against these regions with BWA-MEM and read counts were called on the resulting BAM file with Salmon v0.13.1 (86). Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed with DESeq2 (87). The p-values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg (88) correction. For each pair, the resistant strain expression, including those samples grown in sub-MIC concentrations of antimicrobials, were individually compared to the expression of the susceptible strain. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed for differentially expressed regions identified in the RNA-Seq analysis (Table S3); a constitutively expressed target (locus tag: IX87_18340), based on analysis of RNA-Seq data, was included for normalization. cDNA was amplified with the following protocol: 1X Promega PCR Master Mix (Promega, Fitchburg, WI), 2.5 μL cDNA template, and multiplexed primer concentrations listed in Table S3. Gene specific PCR parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 m, 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 m. Included on each primer was a universal tail (89), which facilitated Illumina index ligation. Samples were indexed with the following final concentrations: 1X HiFi HotStart Readymix (Kapa Biosystems Inc., Wilmington, MA), 0.4 μM of each indexing primer, and 2 μL of gene specific PCR product. The indexing PCR parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 m, 6 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 20 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 m. Following each PCR, a 1X Agencourt AMPure bead (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) clean-up was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. All amplicons were normalized with SequalPrep (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Applied Biosystems), pooled, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Raw AmpSeq data were aligned against predicted amplicons with Kallisto v0.45.0 (90); predicted amplicons were identified by the in silico extraction of sequence between matching primer pairs. Counts were normalized based on the median read counts between all samples. The difference, or delta, between the raw read counts of the target and a constitutively expressed reference housekeeping gene was identified for each sample. The average delta was then identified for each set of resistant and intermediate genomes and the delta Ct was calculated. The average deltas were compared between resistant and intermediate samples and a p-value was calculated with a Mann-Whitney U test. All data were deposited to appropriate databases and linked under BioProject PRJNA497581. Accession information for specific samples is shown in Table S1.
All subjects will be prescribed anti-convulsant medication following screening, prior to initiation of subsequent study procedures. This anti-convulsant (levetiracetam, 500 mg daily) will be continued for a minimum of 6 weeks unless the subject exhibits an adverse reaction (43). Thereafter, the anticonvulsant may be weaned or discontinued at the discretion of the attending veterinarian. After screening, preoperative assessment and informed consent as described above, all subjects will receive general anesthesia and undergo a gross total or partial surgical resection of tumor by veterinary neurosurgeons at Day 0. A catheter will be placed intraoperatively, with the distal end positioned in the tumor bed and the proximal end secured to a subcutaneous reservoir to be used for infusion. Post-operative CT imaging will be performed to confirm appropriate catheter placement. If a catheter is determined to be out of position by the lead investigator, then the catheter will be repositioned, with placement again confirmed by CT imaging. The subcutaneous reservoirs and catheters will be left in place for up to 3 months to serve as imaging fiducials or indefinitely (after 3 months, they may be removed if necessary. Placement is subcutaneous and removal may be performed in a clinic setting as an outpatient surgery with sedation). Each dog will be continuously monitored after surgery in the veterinary intensive care unit until they have regained consciousness and maintain normal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. They will then be monitored per protocol at each veterinary site until discharge, typically on post-operative day 3 or 4. Distress of pain is not anticipated during any of these phases but should there be any pain behaviors, the subjects will be immediately treated with partial opioids (butorphanol or buprenorphine), opioids (fentanyl), alpha-agonists (dexmedetomidine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (carprofen), and/or tramadol unless contraindicated. Within 48 h of surgery, intratumoral infusion of M032 will begin. Provided no unacceptable toxicities are encountered, at least one cohort of three animals will be enrolled at each dosing level. Dose escalation decision criteria are outlined in Table 3 and the dose escalation schedule is described in Table 4. Based on each subject's dosing cohort, the indicated dose of M032 will be administered in a standardized volume of ~0.5 ml through the catheter via percutaneous injection into the subcutaneous reservoir, followed by a 0.5 ml infusion of sterile vehicle (Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline plus 10% glycerol; Avanti Pharmaceutical). Once the MTD/RP2D of M032 has been established, subsequent dogs will receive M032 of 1 log below this dose and 4 weeks of daily Indoximod following surgery, catheter placement and CT confirmation. An in-depth analysis of immune response is needed to understand the effects of M032 alone and combined with checkpoint inhibition. The study schedule is shown in Table 5. Following surgical resection of tumor and intratumoral infusion of M032, animals will be assessed at regular intervals (days 1, 2, 3, 14, and months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12) with quality of life assessments, physical and neurologic examinations, and laboratory studies to monitor objective response to ongoing treatment. Preoperative screening MRI will serve as the baseline imaging study and follow-up scans will be performed at study day 28, and at months 3 and 6. Intratumoral changes will also be assessed indirectly by evaluating plasma levels of cytokines and shifts in immune related circulating lymphoid cells. Blood, saliva, and conjunctival smears will be collected. HSV detection will be performed. These studies will provide valuable information about the immune response of the dog to the HSV immunotherapy and will be extraordinarily useful in Stage II with the addition of the checkpoint inhibitor. After discharge, all subjects will be followed closely for evidence of adverse events. In addition to monitoring for signs of any adverse events, subjects in Stage 2 will have blood samples drawn to measure serum/plasma baseline and post-Indoximod kynurenine levels longitudinally by ELISA to determine any correlations with immune profile changes. Data from stage I will be used to determine the extent to which the dog's immune system is responding differently to the combination therapy. Study schedule. Blood only. Appendix B in . AED discontinued prior to 6 weeks if adverse reaction. After 6 weeks, continuation is at the discretion of attending veterinarian. Stage 2 of trial. Proliferation of T (CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+) and NK (CD3− CD94+ Nkp46+) cells within isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be evaluated and compared pre and post-treatment. Specifically, PBMC (2 × 106) will be labeled with CFSE (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) and then cultured for 72 h alone or in the presence of UV-inactivated M032 (1 × 108 pfu/ml). Cells will be analyzed by flow cytometry for proliferation by CFSE dilution. Second, PBMCs will be cultured for 72 h alone or in the presence of M032 and assayed by flow cytometry and ELISpot for expression of IFN-γ (TH1) and IL-4 (TH2). Distribution of immune cell types within peripheral blood will be assessed using multi-parameter flow cytometry with a focus on T (CD3+ CD4+ Foxp3− T helper, CD3+ CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory, and CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells), B cells (CD79a+ CD21+ IgG+/−), NK cells (CD94+ NKp46+), neutrophils (CD11b+ CAD048A+ MHCIIlow CD14−), and monocytes (CD11b+, CD14+, MHCIIlow/int). The activation status of T and B cell subsets will be assessed using antibody combinations to elucidate naïve (CD44lo CD62Lhi), effector (CD44hi CD45RAlo CD62Llo), and central memory (CD44hi CD45RAlo CD62Lhi). We will also quantify total serum IgG and HSV-specific IgG antibody titers and determine whether HSV-specific antibodies can induce NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as an indicator of antitumor immunity using in vitro cell based assays. Antibodies to HSV from the serum will be co-incubated with purified NK cells and tumor cells at various NK:tumor cell ratios to determine whether HSV-specific antibodies can modulate NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis. Systemic immune distribution of HSV will be evaluated through direct assessment of serum HSV-titers, in vitro culture, quantification of human IL-12, and quantitative PCR for HSV dsDNA. The presence of HSV in saliva and conjunctival samples will be evaluated by qPCR. High quality, appropriately processed tumor tissue from all subjects will undergo histologic analysis by three independent veterinary pathologists. Routine histopathology will be compared to extensively described histopathologic features of human tumors and based on the classification scheme proposed by Koehler at al. (44). We will conduct immunohistochemistry of recurrent tumor resected prior to HSV infusion and on any tumor tissue obtained from subsequent surgical resection or necropsy. We are interested in infiltration of various subsets of immune-related inflammatory cells (as described above) as well as changes in expression of proliferation markers (Ki-67), endothelial cell markers (vWF, CD31) and the presence of any HSV virus antigens.
All human 5′UTRs, the 44-vertebrates alignment (phastCons44way table) and sequence conservation scores (SCS) were obtained from UCSC (hg18 genome) (Tyner et al., 2017). Branch length score (BLS) was computed for each human 5′UTR as described in Dassi et al. (2013) and averaged with SCS to derive the hyperconservation score (HCS). Then, a sliding-window algorithm, starting with fully conserved 5-nucleotides seeds (HCS = 1.0) and expanding them upstream and downstream until a score threshold of 0.85 is reached, was applied to the 5′UTRs as described in Dassi et al. (2013), obtaining hyperconserved elements (HCEs). The threshold of 0.85 was chosen to have each score component (SCS and BLS) not lower than 0.7 when the other is 1.0 and vice versa, thus ensuring that HCEs are only the most conserved regions. Identified regions were then lifted over to the hg19 assembly and checked for consistency and being in a 5′UTR. Functional enrichments were computed by DAVID (Huang et al., 2007) using Gene Ontology, INTERPRO, PFAM, and SMART annotations. The full catalog of 5′HCEs has been added to the AURA2 database (Dassi et al., 2014), reachable at http://aura.science.unitn.it. De novo motif search was performed on homeotic genes 5′HCEs with DynaMIT (Dassi and Quattrone, 2016), using Weeder (Pavesi et al., 2004) for sequence motifs (length 6–12 nts with 1–4 mismatches resp.; motif in ≥ 25% of sequences), RNAforester (Höchsmann et al., 2003) for secondary structure motifs (multiple alignment, local search mode), and “co-occurrence” as motif integration strategy. The best integrated motif from DynaMIT was used, keeping only positions with ≥ 10 supporting sequences, thus trimming the motif. Trimmed parts represent the lowly-supported ends of individual motifs with respect to the core shared by multiple motifs. The PWMs for 193 RBPs were obtained from CISBP-RNA (Ray et al., 2013). Pearson correlation between PWMs and the motif was computed by TFBSTools (Tan and Lenhard, 2016). The RBMX PWM was matched against homeotic 5′HCE sequences with Biopython (Cock et al., 2009). Only PWMs ≥ 4 nts long were used, retaining matches with score > 70%. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 0.01 mM l-glutamine (Gibco, United States), and maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. We performed RBMX knock-down as described in Matsunaga et al. (2012). We used RBMX siRNA-1 (5′-UCAAGAGGAUAUAGCGAUATT-3′) and siRNA-2 (5′-CGGAUAUGGUGGAAGUCGAUU-3′) for knock-down, and negative control siRNA S5C-060 (Cosmo Bio, Japan). 1.5 × 106 HEK293 cells were seeded into two 10 cm Petri dishes and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000, using a mixture of both siRNA at 25 nM. Full-length RBMX was amplified by PCR using HeLa cells cDNA and the Fw: 5′ GAGGCGATCGCCGTTGAAGCAGATCGCCCAGGAA 3′ and Rv: 5′GCGACGCGTCTAGTATCTGCTTCTGCCTCCC 3′primers. The amplified fragment was digested with the SgfI and MluI restriction enzymes and cloned into the pCMV6-AN-His-HA plasmid (PS100017, OriGene, United States), obtain the pCMV6-HIS-HA-RBMX vector. The construct was confirmed by sequencing. HEK293 cells were transfected as described above, with 2 μg of pCMV6-HIS-HA-RBMX or the mock empty vector as control. RNA extractions were performed 48 h post-transfection. All experiments were run in biological triplicate. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) was performed in biological triplicate with HEK293 cells transfected with pCMV6-HIS-HA-RBMX or the mock empty vector. Cell extracts were resuspended in NT2 buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40 supplemented with fresh 200 U RNase Out, 20 mM EDTA and a protease inhibitor cocktail), chilled at 4°C. Anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, United States) were saturated in the NT2 buffer (adding 5% BSA for 1 h at 4°C), then added to lysates. The immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4°C in gentle rotation conditions, the immunoprecipitate washed four times with NT2 and resuspended in the same buffer. RNA extraction was performed from 10% of the volume of both the input and immunoprecipitate, using TRIzol (Invitrogen, United States). FYN was used as positive and HNRNPM as negative control (Heinrich et al., 2009). Polysomal profiling was performed according to the protocol in Dassi et al. (2013). Cells were treated with cycloheximide, lysed in 300 μl lysis buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 g and 4°C. Lysates loaded on a 15–50% linear sucrose gradient were centrifuged at 4°C for 100 min at 180,000 g (SW41Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter, United States), and 1 mL fractions collected by continuous monitoring absorbance at 254 nm. Total RNA was obtained by pooling 20% of each fraction. To extract RNA, fractions were treated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K (Euroclone, Italy) for 2 h at 37°C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation, RNA was resuspended in 30 μl RNase-free water. RNA was assessed by an Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified by a Qubit (Life Technologies, United States). Ten percent of each sucrose gradient fraction was pooled (knock-down/overexpression validation) or processed separately (RBMX polysomes distribution) to extract proteins using TCA/acetone precipitation. Proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with RBMX (Abcam, United Kingdom), HA (Bethyl Laboratories, United States) and RPL26 antibodies (Abcam, United Kingdom). Blots were processed by an ECL Prime detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, United Kingdom). Libraries were prepared in biological triplicate with 500ng RNA of each sample according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the RIP and the RBMX knock-down we used a TruSeq Targeted RNA Custom Panel Kit (Illumina, United States), sequenced with a 50-cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (Illumina, United States) on a MiSeq machine. For the overexpression, we used the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, United States), sequenced on six lanes at 2 × 100 bp on a HiSeq 2500 machine. Reads were preprocessed (quality < Q30, adapters stripped) with trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014), then aligned to the hg38 genome (GENCODE v27 annotation) with bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) or STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Gene read counts were normalized by library size. Targeted RNA-seq samples with < 10 mapped reads per gene were discarded. RIP fold enrichment was computed for each replicate as (RIP_RBMX-IP/INPUT_RBMX-IP)/(RIP_HA-IP/INPUT_HA-IP). This targeted assay does not fit the assumptions of differential expression (DE) determination methods (reads distribution, fraction of DE genes), so we used a Wilcoxon test. For conventional RNA-seq, DE was computed with DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). Polysomal samples were compared as siRBMX/CTRL and the same was done for total samples. A gene was then defined polysomal (or total) DEG if it exhibited a significant change in one level not matched by a significant change in the other. Differential exon usage was computed by DEXseq (Anders et al., 2012) (adjusted p ≤ 0.05 for both analyses).
In this study, we totally collected whole genome sequencing data of 73 animals. Among them, 66 genome data of 8 cattle breeds were downloaded from the NCBI database, including 20 samples of Angus, 12 samples of Hereford, 7 samples of Boran, 4 samples of Brahman, 3 samples of Gir, 7 samples of Kenana, 6 samples of Nelore, 7 samples of Ogaden. We sampled another 4 N’dama and 3 Muturu from African Bos taurus. DNA was extracted from ear-tissue samples that were obtained from animals in farms of the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training, Ibadan. The animals were released immediately after collecting the samples. Paired-end libraries were constructed and sequenced using the Hiseq 2000 platform (Accession number for GEO database: PRJNA604048). In addition, to analyze the differential CNVs between the two subspecies, we downloaded four liver RNA sequencing data of Bos taurus (SRR1607562 and SRR1607566) and Bos indicus (SRR6798334 and SRR6798339), one whole genome bisulfate sequencing data (SRX3367857) of the blood genome DNA from the NCBI database. The detail information of all the data used in this study can be found in the supplement data (Table S6). The adapter and low-quality reads were filtered using the NGS QC Toolkit (v2.3.3) software using the parameters as -p 8 -l 70 -s 20 -z g. The clean reads were mapped on the latest cattle genome reference (ARS-UCD1.2, a Hereford-based genome assembly) using the BWA (v 0.7.17) software with the default parameters and the MEM algorithm. We called CNV by combining the advantages of both LUMPY and CNVnator. Briefly, the sorted bam files were first processed using PEM and SR strategies in LUMPY (−mw 4 -tt 0 -pe) to obtain the type and the accurate CNV boundaries at a single base resolution. Then we applied a RD strategy using CNVnator software with a bin size of 350 bp to annotate the detailed copy number [54]. Only CNVs identified as the same type in both LUMY and CNVnator were considered as confidential CNV for further analysis in this study. The CNVR were generated by merging the overlapped CNVs from different individuals. After considering the intersections between results of LUMPY and CNVnator, only CNVR supported by at least 4 animals were kept (Table S1). This illustrated the high confidence for CNVRs we detected. CNVs were divided to segments using a python script according to the different boundaries, as described before [55]. We defined the genotype of CNV segments for each individual according to the type of unique CNV it belonged to. In order to be consistent, each produced CNV segment would have same boundaries in different individuals. Only CNV segment longer than 50 bp was considered for further genotyping. The F-statistics (F) value was calculated according to the formulation in previous study [56, 57]. F = (Ht − Hs) / Ht; Ht = 1 − Pti2; ti = ((xi · Nx) + (yi · Ny)) / (Nx + Ny); Hs = ((1 − Pxi2) · Nx + (1 − Pyi2) · Ny) / (Nx + Ny), where xi and yi are the population frequencies of allelic CNV segment number i (i = A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 or > A4) in population X and Y, respectively, Nx and Ny denote the number of individuals in population X and Y, and ti is a weighted average of xi and yi. The annotation files used in this study were downloaded from the Ensembl database (http://asia.ensembl.org/index.html). The overlap cases were detected using R script (v3.6.0) and defined as at least one bp overlap. The gene IDs were used to query gene ontology terms using DAVID with Fisher’s exact test (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). We used the HISAT2 to map the read from RNA sequencing data on the cattle reference genome using the default parameters. The clean reads for RNA sequencing data were aligned on the reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2) along with annotated genes in the Ensembl database (http://asia.ensembl.org/index.html) using the HISAT2 v2.1.0 with the default parameters to generate the bam file containing the mapping information. The .bam file was inputted to the IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) software (http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) to visualize the reads distribution in specific regions. The WGBS data was processed according to our previous study [58]. In brief, programs FastQC (v 0.11.2) and Trim Galore (v 0.4.0) were used to generate sequence quality reports and to trim low-quality bases and the adapter sequences, respectively. High-quality reads were aligned to the reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2) using bowtie2 under the Bismark software (0.14.5) with the parameters -p 3 -N 1 -D 20. The methylcytosine information was extracted using the bismark methylation extractor, after removing the duplication reads. The first 6 bp were ignored for the paired-end reads to decrease the potential effects of severe bias toward nonmethylation in the end-of-reads caused by end repairing. Genomic DNA for different breeds extracted from semen were obtained from the Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) beef cattle diversity panel, version 2.1; MBCDP2.1, as described before (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11252171/). We designed primers (forward: CTGAGCAACTGCCATTCCGT; reverse: ACCATGACAAGCTTACTAGGGGT) based on the newest version of the cattle genome (ARS-UCD1.2). The PCR amplification was performed with 50 μL reaction volume according to Taq DNA polymerase manufacturer’s protocol (Taq PCR Master Mix Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the genomic DNA was amplified on a bioRad MyIQ thermocycler. The touchdown PCR cycle for target region amplification was as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min; followed by 18 cycles of 94 °C for 30s, annealing at 68 °C ~ 50 °C (decrease 1 °C per cycle) for 30s; 22 cycles of 94 °C for 30s, annealing at 50 °C for 30s; primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. All the amplified products were run in 1.5% agarose gel.
Tianzhu white yaks with fine fiber production trait were used in this study. All the yaks were obtained from the Tianzhu white yak propagation bases of Gansu province, China. Female yaks about 2 years old in similar shape (coefficient of relationship < 0.125) were selected for sample collection in different phases of the HFs cycle that included the following five time points: Jan., Mar., Jun., Aug., and Oct.. Skin samples of 3 yaks at each point were collected from the scapulae region using a medical skin sampler after local injection of 2% lidocaine and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for further processing. Veterinary streptomycin sulfate and penicillin potassium powders were applied to the wound and put a sterile dressing over the wound. The animal wounds can heal completely within a month. The samples were collected at the adjacent site in each distinct phase. All the experimental procedures involved in this study were approved by the Animal Management and Ethics Committee of the Lanzhou Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Permit No. SYXK-2016-0039). Total RNA of skin tissues was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocols, after grinding them in liquid nitrogen. RNA integrity was analyzed using an RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). RNA concentration and purity were measured with the Nanodrop 2000 photometer spectrophotometer (Implen, CA, USA). Approximately 3 μg RNA was used for RNA library preparation. First, ribosomal RNA was removed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with a Ribo-Zero Gold Kit (Illumina, CA, USA). Subsequently, interruption reagent was added to break the rRNA-depleted RNA into short fragments, and the latter RNA was used as a template. Random hexamer primers were used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA, and then the second-strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. In the reaction system of second-strand cDNA, dUTP was used instead of dTTP. Then, different adapters were connected, and the UNG enzyme method was used to digest the strand containing dUTP, only retaining the first cDNA strands with different linkers. After purification of the cDNA strands, the remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via polymerase/exonuclease activities, and adenylation of the 3′ ends were performed. The sequencing adapter was ligated and the cDNA fragments of 150–200 bp in length were selected to perform PCR amplification. Finally, the PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system), and RNA library quality was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Kapa BioSystems, MA, USA). The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed using TruSeq PE Cluster reagent (Illumina, CA, USA) on a cBot Cluster generation system following the manufacturer’s protocols. Then, the cDNA libraries were subjected to standard paired-end sequencing with an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Raw reads were trimmed by removing adapter sequences, reads containing over 10% of poly -N, and low-quality bases (> 50% of bases whose Phred scores were < 5%) using in-house Perl scripts. The valid bases, Phred score (Q30) and GC content were used to filter high quality clean data. The alignment of paired-end clean reads to the reference genome (versionGCA_005887515.2 BosGru3.0) was performed using the hisat2 [32]. The mapped reads of each library were assembled using Cufflinks (v2.1.1) in a reference-based approach [33]. For the prediction of lncRNAs, reassembling of transcripts was performed using a streaming neural network algorithm with StringTie software [34], which could accurately determine the direction of transcript chains for the data of chain-specific library. Based on the characteristics of lncRNAs, a strict four-step procedure was used to identify lncRNAs from the assembled transcripts: (1) spliced transcripts were compared with reference transcripts using Cuff-compare v2.1.1 [33] to remove known coding transcripts or loci, and the location type of the remaining transcripts was determined; (2) transcripts with length < 200 bp or exon number < 2 were removed; (3) the coding potential of transcripts was analyzed to remove transcripts with coding potential. The analytic software was CNCI (v2) [35], CPC (0.9-r2) [36], Pfam-scan (v1.3) [37], and PLEK [38]. (4) LncRNA transcripts obtained in the third step were used to align the annotated lncRNAs in yak with Blastn software, the transcripts overlapped with known lncRNAs of yak were removed, and novel lncRNAs were screened. Then, novel lncRNAs and known lncRNA transcripts were used for further quantitative analysis. FEELnc [39] was used to classify and count the different types of identified novel lncRNAs based on the positional relationship with their closest protein coding transcripts; the classification involved four sides including direction (sense or antisense), type (genic or intergenic), location (e.g. upstream for lincRNA or exonic for genic lncRNAs), and subtype (e.g. divergent for lincRNAs or containing for genic lncRNAs). Fragments per kilobase for a million reads (FPKM) of lncRNA transcripts was calculated with Cuffdiff (v2.1.1) [40]. DESeq [41] was used to normalize the lncRNA counts of each skin sample (basemen value to estimate the expression). P value < 0.05 and foldchange > 2 was set as the threshold for significantly differential expression between any two distinct phases of HFs growth. Based on the count data of lncRNA expression, sample similarities of the three groups (Jan., Mar., and Oct.) was analyzed via principal component analysis (PCA). Besides, heatmap showing the Euclidean distance between the samples as calculated from the variance stabilizing transformation of the count data, also was used to check the consistency of the biological replicates. The nearest protein-coding gene paired with each lncRNA was searched as the potential regulatory target gene of that lncRNA. If no gene was detected within 100 kb upstream or downstream of a lncRNA, that lncRNA was excluded in subsequent analysis. Function enrichment analysis of the target genes between any two groups DELs were performed, using the clusterProfiler R package depends on gene ontology (GO) database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, to calculate enrichment test for GO terms and KEGG pathways based on hypergeometric distribution [42]. The protein-protein interaction network of all the nearby genes paired with DELs was analyzed with the STRING database (https://string-db.org/), and further visualized with Cytoscape V3.5.1 (http://www.cytoscape.org/). Total RNA from the skin tissue subjected to RNA sequencing was also used to verify the sequencing results by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The first-strand cDNA was obtained using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The RT-qPCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) on the Bio-Rad CFX96 TouchReal-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The reaction conditions were set as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 12 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The relative expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs was analyzed with the 2−ΔΔCt method and normalized using GAPDH. The primers used for RT-qPCR were designed with oligo 6 and are listed in Additional file 1. To further screen the key lncRNAs in the HFs cycle of yak, DELs paired with differently expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by comparing analysis the lncRNA data with our previous mRNA data [43]. Then, these DELs were used for sequence conservation analysis with the lncRNA data of cashmere goat during the HFs cycle using NCBI BLAST-2.9.0+ [44] with parameters of“Gap Penalties: Existence 0, Extension 2.5, Expectation value 1e-10”. The lncRNA dataset of the cashmere goat was used as “blastdb database”, and the DELs of the yak were used as “query database”. The lncRNA dataset of the cashmere goat was downloaded from a previous study [19]. The sequence conservation properties were analyzed using dottup website, WebLogo3 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/), Clone Manager bioinformatics software, and so forth.
This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital and School of Stomatology, Wuhan University (No. 2020-B29). Informed consent was obtained from the included subjects through express delivery. To obtain information about the infected OHCWs, we initially retrieved data from the Hubei Stomatological Association (HSA) between January 1 and March 31, 2020. There are 3,566 HSA members in Hubei Province, of whom 1,533 are in Wuhan, including 394 members in private dental clinics. Thereafter, to confirm the data, we made phone calls to all the related dental institutions in Wuhan. Information on 32 infected OHCWs in Wuhan was reported. Then, we further determined whether there were infected OHCWs in the other 34 public general or specialized hospitals based on the data from the Health Annals of Wuhan in 2019. Information regarding another 2 OHCWs with COVID-19 in Wuhan was also collected. With regard to the private dental clinics, 183 dental clinics in Wuhan employ approximately 606 OHCWs. However, a regulation was released by the Hubei government on January 27, 2020, regarding dental services during the outbreak that stated that only emergency dental cases could be treated during the strict implementation of infection prevention and control measures. All private clinics were closed in Wuhan during the epidemic, and the information on infection was mainly obtained from the situation report released by the HSA, which reported 4 infected OHCWs who worked in 3 private clinics in Wuhan. Both telephone interviews and questionnaires were used to collect information from the OHCWs with COVID-19. We developed a questionnaire (Table 1) to collect the epidemiological and clinical information, which consisted of 3 parts: 1) general information: name, age, gender, name of medical institution, occupation, and department; 2) clinical information: clinical symptoms and signs, admission and discharge dates, and medical discharge record; and 3) epidemiological information: exposure history, direct work in a fever clinic, potential source of infection, infection status in occupational or household settings, and prevention and control measures in the workplace. Questionnaire of Oral Health Care Workers with COVID-19 in Wuhan. To collect information on dental services performed during the epidemic, the medical records pertaining to emergency dental treatments were collected from the Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University as an example from January 23 to April 7, 2020. Diagnosis and treatments were recorded and classified. Continuous variables are expressed as the medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables are summarized as counts and percentages. Because the subjects in our study were not randomly selected, all statistics are purely descriptive. All the analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 (SPSS, Inc.).
Lactobacillus casei strain W56 (Lc W56) was isolated from cattle feces followed by identification of morphology, biochemical reaction, and 16S rDNA sequencing in our laboratory and was cultured in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) broth (Sigma, St.Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C. The strain Lc W56 shows good probiotics proprieties, including good colonization ability in intestine [23], tolerance to extreme digestive environments (hypertonic environment of 9% NaCl, 0.5% bile, and gastric environment of pH 1.5) and intestinal fluid environment. Moreover, the strain Lc W56 can effectively promote animal growth performance and protect animal against enteropathogenic bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli K99) infection. Vibrio cholerae strain OG80 was kept in our laboratory. Cytopathic (CP) BVDV-1 strain ZD-2018 was propagated in MDBK cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2, which was isolated from the calf suffering from diarrhea by our laboratory and identified by virus propagation, indirect immunofluorescence assay, and gene sequencing. The constitutive expression plasmid pPG-T7g10-PPT was constructed in our lab. The recombinant plasmid pMD-E2 containing the full-length E2 gene of BVDV strain ZD-2018 was constructed in our lab [23]. Five-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) BALB/c mice were obtained from Changsheng Biotechnology Company (Shenyang, China), and feed by a standard mouse diet and water. Primers were designed in this work by the Oligo 6.0 software, and details of primers were provided in Table 1. Details of primers used in this study aUnderlining indicates restriction enzyme recognize site bItalic indicates the gene encoding flexible linker (GGGGS)2 The process of constructing recombinant Lactobacillus pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Briefly, we used the pMD-E2 plasmid as a template to amplify the full-length E2 gene by PCR with the primer pair E2-F/E2-R containing Sac I site and Apa I restriction site, respectively. This PCR product was then subcloned as a Sac I and Apa I gene fragment into the plasmid pPG-T7g10-PPT, generating the recombinant plasmid pPG-E2. Subsequently, the whole gene encoding ctxB was obtained by PCR amplification with the primer pair ctxB-F/ctxB-R, using the genomic DNA of V. cholerae OG80 as a template that was extracted by a Bacterial Genomic DNA Extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). This PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and ApaI and inserted into the plasmid pPG-E2 to obtain the recombinant plasmid pPG-E2-ctxB, of which E2 and ctxB were linked by a flexible linker (GGGGS)2. Next, the plasmid pPG-E2-ctxB was electroporated into the Lc W56 competent cells, generating the recombinant Lactobacillus pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56. The preparation of competent cells and electroporation were performed as the method described previously [35–37]. Briefly, Lc W56 was cultured in MRS broth until OD600≈0.3 for preparing competent cells; then, 50 ng of plasmid pPG-E2-ctxB was gently mixed with 200 µL of Lc W56 competent cells, transferred into a pre-cooled Gene Pulser™ cuvette (inter-electrode distance of 0.2 cm), and placed into a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) followed by a single electric pulse (2,500 V/cm; 25 µF); the treated Lc W56 was grown in recovery medium (MRS broth supplemented with 0.3 M sucrose), and the positive recombinant strain was selected on MRS agar medium containing 10 μg/mL chloromycetin. Construction of the recombinant Lactobacillus strains and identification of the proteins of interest expressed by the recombinant Lactobacillus strains. a Schematic illustration of the construction of the recombinant pPG-E2 and pPG-E2-ctxB plasmids. b Identification of the proteins of interest expressed by the recombinant strains pPG-E2/Lc W56 and pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 using Western blot with mouse anti-E2 or anti-ctxB mAb, respectively. c Identification of the E2 protein expressed by pPG-E2/Lc W56 by IFA. d Identification of the fusion protein E2-ctxB expressed by pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 by IFA Recombinant Lactobacillus pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 was grown in MRS broth at 37 °C for 16 h. After centrifugation at 10,000×g for 5 min, harvested the bacteria and resuspended with 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer, then placed the cells in boiling water for 10 min followed by another round of centrifugation. Subsequently, the proteins in the supernatants were separated using 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Mouse anti-E2 (1:500) or anti-ctxB (1:200) monoclonal antibody (mAb) prepared by our laboratory were used as the primary antibody, and the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000) (Sigma, USA) were used as the secondary antibody, respectively. Immunoblotting were taken by a chemiluminescent substrate reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). In addition, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed to detect the expression of the fusion protein in the recombinant Lactobacillus pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56. In brief, the pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 grown overnight in MRS broth was washed two times with sterile PBS followed by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 10 min. Next, the pellets were incubated with mouse anti-E2 mAb (1:500) or anti-ctxB mAb (1:200) as the primary antibody, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) as the secondary antibody. After washing three times with PBS, the fluorescence signals on the cell surface of recombinant strain were observed by laser confocal microscopy. Moreover, the expression levels of E2 protein in the pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 and pPG-E2/Lc W56 were analyzed by Western blot assay. Briefly, one milliliter of the recombinant strain pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 and pPG-E2/Lc W56 (OD600 ≈ 1.0) were centrifugated and lysed, respectively; after adjusting total protein concentration of each recombinant strain sample to be the same, Western blot assay was carried out with the mouse anti-E2 mAb to analyze the level of E2 protein expressed in the pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 and the pPG-E2/Lc W56. The experiments were performed according to the methods described previously [23]. Briefly, to test the tolerance to hypertonic environment and bile, the recombinant strain pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 of OD600 ≈ 1.0 was centrifuged, reinoculated respectively in 1 mL of MRS broth supplemented with 4–9% of NaCl, and 0.05–0.5% of bile (wt/vol), and continually cultured at 37 °C for 5 h followed by counting live bacteria using plate method. To test the tolerance to intestinal fluid environment, the recombinant strain pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 (OD600 ≈ 1.0) was reinoculated in 1 mL of simulated intestinal fluid at 37 °C for 3 h followed by counting live bacteria using plate method at 30-min intervals. Significantly, we tested the tolerance of the pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 to rumen fluid of cattle in vitro. The recombinant strain of OD600≈1.0 was reinoculated in 1 mL of rumen fluid of cattle with pH 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, or 4.5, and continually cultured at 37 °C for 2.5 h followed by counting live bacteria using plate method. On day 7 after oral vaccination, the Peyer’s patches (PPs) in the small intestine of mice (n = 5) in the pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 group were isolated to detect the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) induced by the recombinant strain pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56. Briefly, PPs were harvested from the small intestine of the mice in each group, placed in 5 mL of pre-cooled Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), grinded gently, and filtered using a 200-mesh stainless steel mesh, followed by centrifugation at 500×g for 10 min. Subsequently, the cells were then resuspended using 8 mL HBSS, placed into 5 mL of 70% Percoll (Sigma, USA) solution in 15 mL centrifuge tubes, followed by centrifugation at 500×g for 20 min. The cells on the interface were collected and washed two times with HBSS, then resuspended by HBSS at a concentration of 106/mL. After that, the harvested cells were incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) to block the Fc receptors, washed two times with HBSS, and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD40 and CD86 antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Finally, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. As a control, cells were collected from the pPG-E2/Lc W56, pPG/Lc W56, and PBS groups. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. On day 7 after oral vaccination with the recombinant strains, the expression of Bcl-6 in T lymphocytes of the PPs obtained from the mice (n = 5) in pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56, pPG-E2/Lc W56, pPG/Lc W56, and PBS groups was analyzed using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. Briefly, the PPs were isolated from the mice in these groups, and then fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution, coated with paraffin, followed by the establishment of tissue sections. Next, the tissue sections were incubated with mouse anti-Bcl-6 mAb (Abcam, MA, USA) at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, USA) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), respectively. Subsequently, the expression of Bcl-6 was visually evaluated using an inverted microscope. At the same time, the PPs isolated from the mice (n = 5) in these groups were grinded gently using a 300-mesh stainless steel mesh and rinsed with PBS. After centrifugation at 1000×g for 5 min, the resulting cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS, followed by staining with the corresponding antibodies (2 µl of anti-mouse CXCR5/APC and anti-mouse CD4/PE, respectively). The percentage of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry (cells without staining were used as negative control, and cells stained with CXCR5/APC or CD4/PE were used as compensation controls, and the cells labeled with both CXCR5 and CD4 are regarded as CD4+CXCR5+ T cells). In addition, the collected cells were incubated by anti-mouse IgA/FITC, anti-mouse B220/PerCP-Cy5, and anti-mouse IgM/PE-Cy7, and the percentage of B220+IgM+ B lymphocytes, B220+IgA+ B lymphocytes, and B220−IgA+ plasma blast was then determined by flow cytometry. The experiment was performed in parallel triplicate repeats. The recombinant strain pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 cultured for 12 h in MRS broth was washed once and resuspended with PBS containing 5% casein peptone and 0.5% glucose at the concentration of 1010 CFU/mL. The mice (n = 50) were orally vaccinated with 200 μL of recombinant pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 by the gavage needles. The mice were vaccinated consecutively for three days as previously described [23]. In brief, on days 1–3, primary vaccination was given, then days 15–17, is time for the second vaccination and on days 28–30, the final vaccination was given. In parallel, the mice in other three groups (50 mice per group) that were orally administered with pPG-E2/Lc W56, pPG/Lc W56, and PBS were used as control. The samples including serum, feces, intestinal mucus, nasal fluid, and genital tract fluid were harvested from mice (n = 5) in each group on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63 after primary vaccination. All samples were treated as methods previously described [22, 23], and then stored at − 80 °C until used. The levels of anti-BVDV IgG antibody in the serum and anti-BVDV sIgA antibody in the intestinal mucus, nasal fluid, genital tract fluid, and feces samples were detected by ELISA. In brief, 96-well polystyrene plates were coated with 200 TCID50 (107.2/0.1 mL) BVDV strain ZD-2018 at 4 °C for 12 h. After washing three times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20), the plates were blocked with 5% skim milk at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by washing with PBST. Next, the serum sample (1:100) and other samples (1:10) used as the primary antibodies were added into the plates and kept in 37 °C for 1 h, followed by washing three times with PBST. Subsequently, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or IgA antibody (1:5000) (Sigma, USA) was added as the secondary antibody into the plates, and kept in 37 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with PBST, the substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was used for color development, followed by the measurement of absorbance at 450 nm. On the 42d post primary vaccination, the levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, and IFN-γ in the serum of these groups were analyzed by ELISA Kits (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Moreover, an IHC assay was performed, as described above, to detect the antigen-specific sIgA-secreting cells in the PPs of the mice collected from each group using the anti-E2 sIgA antibody induced by pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56. On the 42 days post primary vaccination, the neutralizing ability against BVDV of serum IgG and mucosal sIgA antibodies collected from four groups was determined. Briefly, 100 µL of antibody (serum IgG and mucosal sIgA) samples were diluted serially (twofold) in a 96-well plate, followed by the addition of equal volumes of BVDV strain ZD-2018 (200 TCID50) into the plate and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The antibody-BVDV mixture were then transferred onto a MDBK cell monolayer and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 days, after which we evaluated the cytopathic effects (CPE). Five technical (five samples) with eight biological replicas for each sample were taken for each group. The neutralizing ability of each sample was calculated using the Reed-Muench method and the result of each group was shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). On the 42 days post the primary vaccination, the splenocytes of mice (n = 5) in these four groups were collected, adjusted to a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma, USA), and then added cells into a 96-well plate with eight duplicates (100 μL/well) followed by incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 12 h. The cells were then stimulated using recombinant E2 protein at a concentration of 1, 5, and 25 µg/mL for three days, respectively. In parallel, sample stimulated with 5 µg/mL of concanavalin A, ConA (Sigma, USA) was used as the positive control and RPMI 1640 was used as a mock stimulation control. After adding 10 μL of thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma, USA) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL into each well, the plate was kept in 37 °C for 4 h, and the absorbance of each well was determined at 570 nm. The stimulation index (SI) was calculated as follows: SI = OD570(sample)/OD570(control). In addition, the T lymphocytes subsets in the splenocytes of mice in different groups were detected by flow cytometry after oral vaccination. Briefly, splenocytes with the concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL harvested from these four groups on the 42d post primary vaccination were incubated with anti-mouse CD4/PE antibody and anti-mouse CD8/APC antibody (Abcam, USA) at 37 °C for half an hour, followed by flow cytometry analysis. A challenge experiment was carried out to determine the protective effect of the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine after oral vaccination using mice as the animal model. In brief, a total of 240 mice were separated into four groups (60 mice per group) and were orally vaccinated with pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56, pPG-E2/Lc W56, pPG/Lc W56, and PBS, respectively, according to the vaccination protocol described above. On the 42d post primary vaccination, each mouse in four groups was challenged with 200 µL of 105 TCID50 BVDV strain ZD-2018 propagated in MDBK cells. During a 12d challenge period, the intestine, lung, spleen, blood, and feces samples were collected from the mice (n = 5) in each group per day, and the viral loads in the intestine, lung, spleen, and blood samples were detected using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) with the primer pair 5′UTR-F/5′UTR-R. The viral load of the feces sample was detected using RT-PCR with the same primer pair, 5′UTR-F/5′UTR-R. On day 12 post BVDV infection, the histopathological changes in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, spleen, and small intestine of mice in each group were observed after hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining. The viral antigens in the intestinal mucosa of the mice were detected using an IHC assay with HRP-conjugated mouse anti-E2 mAb prepared by our laboratory. In this work, results were shown as mean ± standard errors (SE) of three replicates each test in a single experiment repeated three times. Tukey’s multiple comparison tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the differences among groups. * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01), and *** (p < 0.001) was considered as significant, which was analyzed by GraphPad Prism V5.0 software.
Five to six-week old male and non-ovariectomized female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from in-house breeding. Mice lacking ERβ specifically in the epithelial cells in the intestine were generated by crossing ERβflox/flox mice (B6.129X1- Esr2tm1Gust, Jan-Åke Gustafsson’s laboratory) with the transgenic mice bearing Cre recombinase expressed under the control of the enterocyte-specific Villin promoter (B6.SJL-Tg(Vil-cre)997 Gum/J; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Littermates (ERβflox/flox) lacking the Cre allele were used as controls (referred to as WT). The genotype was confirmed with standard PCR protocol. Animals were housed under controlled environment at 20 °C with a 12-h light–dark cycle. The animals were fed HFD (D12492, 60% kcal fat, Research Diet) or a control diet corresponding to a matched low-fat diet (D12450J, 10% kcal fat, Research Diet) and water was provided ad libitum. For the treatment with estrogenic ligands, at 10 weeks of diet the mice were injected i.p. every other day for a total of 9 injections with 0.05 (N = 10 for males and 11 for females) or 0.5 mg/kg (N = 10 for males) BW for 17β-estradiol (E2, Sigma-Aldrich ), 2.5 mg/kg BW for 4,4′,4′'-(4-Propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol (PPT, Tocris, N = 5 per group for both females and males), 5 mg/kg BW for 2,3-bis(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN, Tocris, N = 10 for males and 9 for females), or vehicle. The ligands were prepared in a solution of 40% PEG400, 5% DMSO and 55% water. Mice were fasted for 6 h prior the measurement of the glucose level. Briefly, a small piece of the tail was cut with a scalpel, a drop of blood was removed, and glucose level immediately measured with a OneTouch Ultra glucometer (AccuChek Sensor, Roche Diagnostics). Mice were dissected and fat pads from the abdominal and posterior subcutaneous regions carefully removed and weighted. Total fat (TF) was calculated as the sum of all fat depots including gonadal fat, retroperitoneal fat, omental fat and inguinal/gluteal fat depots. Visceral adipose (VAT) comprised of the sum of gonadal fat, retroperitoneal fat and omental fat. The subcutaneous fat (SAT) comprised of the inguinal/gluteal fat depots. All experiments were performed in accordance with ARRIVAL guidelines and EU Directive 2010/63/EU, for the care and use of laboratory animals. The local ethical committee of the Swedish National Board of Animal Research (Stockholm ethical committee, N230/15) approved all experimental protocols. Colons were harvested, washed, measured and opened along the long axis. The colons were then either embedded in OCT (Tissue-tek, Sakura) and prepared for IHC analyses using the “swiss roll” method, or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture at sacrifice using EDTA-treated tubes and plasma was collected after centrifugation and stored at -80 for further analysis. Estradiol levels were measured in mouse plasma by mouse/rat estradiol kit (ES180S-100, Calbiotech) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma samples were diluted 1:5 for vehicle treated CD and HFD and 1:12 for E2 treated mice with assay diluent. Insulin level was measured in plasma by mouse/rat Elisa kit (EZRMI-13K) according to manufacturer’s instructions with plasma samples dilution of 1:2. Calculations were performed using standard controls provided with the kit. Colonic samples embedded in OCT were cryo-sectioned at 8 μm thickness. Sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxidase in 50% methanol and PBS for 30 min. Slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at 4 °C and blocked for unspecific avidin/biotin binding (DAKO). The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies, anti-F4/80+ (1:100, cat# MCA497R, lot# 1608, RRID: AB_323279, Bio-Rad), anti-Ki67 (1:100, SP6, cat# MA5-14520, lot# TC2542944A, RRID AB_10979488, Invitrogen) in 0.1% IGEPAL in PBS. Negative controls without primary antibodies were used for each slide. The sections were incubated with appropriate biotin conjugated anti IgG secondary antibodies (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and then incubated with avidin–biotin complex (ABC, Thermofisher) for 1 h at RT. Sections were developed with Liquid DAB + (3,3-diaminobenzidine) Substrate Chromogen System (DAKO) and counterstained with Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). After dehydration in ethanol and xylene, the slides were cover-slipped using Pertex (Histolab). Ten to fifteen random images from three fully stained sections per animal were randomly taken using a BX53 light microscope and CAM-SC50 camera (Olympus). Positive stained cells per crypts were counted using QuPath and approximately 30 crypts per animal were analyzed. Frozen colon distal tissue and colon epithelial layer were homogenized with a tissue lyser (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Total RNA was isolated with QIAzol and purified using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the standard protocol and on-column DNAse treatment was applied. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the RNA were performed with NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and Agilent Tapestation 2200 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. All samples had RNA integrity > 6.5. One microgram RNA was reversed transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad) according to standard protocol. Ten nanogram of cDNA were used to perform qPCR in the CFX96 Touch System (Biorad), with iTaq universal SYBR Green supermix (Biorad) as recommended by the supplier. Samples were run in duplicates and the relative gene expression was calculated as the mean per group using the ΔΔCt method, normalized to the geometric mean of three reference genes (Actb, Eef2 and Tbp). Primer sequences are provided in supplementary table 1. RNA from colon tissue was prepared from 6 biological replicates, from male and female fed with CD and HFD, and males fed with HFD and treated with E2 (0.5 mg/kg BW). Library preparation (Illumina RiboZero) and sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq6000) was performed at Sweden’s National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI). At least 17 M paired-end reads (2 × 51 bp in length) were generated for each sample, and mapped against mouse genome (GRCm38) using STAR. FeatureCounts and StringTie were used to generate gene counts and TPM values. DESeq2 was used to calculate differentially expressed genes (DEG) with raw counts as input and the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to estimate FDR. Genes were considered as significantly differentially expressed if p value < 0.05 and log2FC >|0.4|. Gene ontology/biological function was performed with DAVID bioinformatics website. GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analysis (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). The results are presented as mean ± SEM. A (two-tailed) Welch's t-test was used for comparison between two groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison between multiple conditions followed by fisher's LSD test. Two-way ANOVA was used for comparison between multiple conditions in two different groups followed by fisher's LSD test. All conditions were compared to HFD vehicle and a p value < 0.05 was considered being statistically significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional scientific ethical review board of University of California, Irvine, USA and Maseno University, Kenya. Permission was sought from the chief of each study site. Written informed consent was obtained from heads of the households, and individuals who were willing to participate in the study. All methods used in this study were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Malaria vector surveillance was conducted in three highland sites (elevation 1500–2300 m) and two lowland sites (1050–1500 m) in western Kenya (Fig. 1). Malaria transmission in highland regions was traditionally regarded as mesoendemic-hyperendemic, unstable, and limited by low temperature, whereas malaria transmission in lowland regions is holoendemic and year around. Between 2015 and 2019, adult mosquitoes were collected in five study sites: Iguhu, Emutete, and Kisii in highland regions; and Kombewa and Homa Bay in lowland regions. Indoor-resting mosquitoes were collected by CDC light traps (CDC-LT) and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) in all study sites. Outdoor-resting mosquitoes were collected by CDC-LT, human landing catches (HLC), clay pot sampling (CP), and pit shelters (PS) sampling methods in Iguhu (2016) and Emutete (2017). These study sites and detailed sampling methods of vector surveillance have been described in previous publications. Adult female anopheline mosquitoes were identified to species by morphological keys for the Afrotropical Anophelinae. The abdominal status of all individuals was classified into unfed, fed, half gravid and gravid. Mosquito samples were stored individually in 1.5 ml tubes containing desiccated silica gel covered with cotton wool. A large subset of morphologically identified mosquitoes (n = 3556) from the collections above were used for DNA extraction, molecular identification of species, and Plasmodium sporozoite infection detections. Female adult mosquitoes were separated individually into head-thoracic portion and abdominal portion for DNA extraction. DNA extraction was performed by using QIAamp 96 DNA QIAcube HT kit on a QIAcube HT 96 automated nucleic acid purification robot (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. Specifically, each individual sample was ground in ZR Bashing Bead Lysis tube (2.0 mm beads, Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, USA) and homogenized in 200 μl lysis solution containing 20 µl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) using the TissueLyser II system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 10 min at 30 Hz. The genomic DNA was eluted in a final volume of 100 µl for head-thoracic portion and 200 µl for abdominal portion. For those specimens morphologically identified to An. gambiae s.l. complex, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Multiplex-PCR) was conducted to distinguish An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis using the species-specific primers (UN/GA/AR) in 28S ribosomal RNA gene according to the method as described by Scott et al.. For those specimens morphologically identified to An. funestus, single PCR was conducted to confirm species using the species-specific primers (ITS2A/FUN) in the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS2) on the ribosomal DNA as described by Koekemoer et al.. For the other species and those specimens which failed to amplify by PCR for clear species-specific band or had non-specific or weak amplifications bands using the species-specific primers, additional two PCR amplifications were performed to further identify morphologically misidentified specimens using the primers UN/GA/AR and ITS2A/FUN, respectively. For the specimens which failed to be identified by PCR, and a subset of 21 randomly selected individuals from each major species, additional PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the ITS2 region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the COX1 gene were performed using the primer pair ITS2A (TGTGAACTGCAGGACACAT) and ITS2B (TATGCTTAAATTCAGGGGGT) for ITS2, and the primer pair: LCO1490 (GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG) and HCO219 (TGATTTTTTGGTCACCCTGAAGTTTA) for COX1. An additional primer pair, 158F (GGTCAACAAATCATAAGGATATTGG) and 890R (GGTCCGAATCCAGGTAAAATTAAA) was designed for COX1 amplification of new species (An. sp.17). The PCR was conducted in a total reaction volume of 17 μl, including 1 μl of DNA template (~ 5 ng), 5 pmol of each primer, and 8.5 μl of DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix (2X) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The thermocycling protocol consisted of an initial activation step of 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 amplification cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 45 s at 72 °C, and a final extension step of 6 min at 72 °C. Five microliters of the amplified fragments were examined by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. PCR products showing a clear single band on the agarose gel were purified using an enzymatic PCR clean-up technique: 0.3 μl of Exonuclease I (ExoI, 20U/μl) and 1.7 μl of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphtase (SAP, 1U/μl) and 8.0 μl of PCR products. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by 15 min at 80 °C to inactivate the enzymes, then held at 4 °C until sequencing. The premixed samples containing 3 μl of cleaned PCR product, 3 μl of forward primer (10 μM), and 12 μl of ddH2O were sent to Retrogen Inc (San Diego, CA) for sequencing. Host blood meal identification of fed mosquitoes was conducted using the multiplexed PCR-based methods as described by Kent et al., with minor modifications. Specifically, PCR was conducted in a total reaction volume of 13 μl, including 1 μl of DNA template (~ 5 ng), 5 pmol of each primer (Forward primers: Pig573F, Human741F, Goat894F, Dog368F, Cow121F, and Reverse primer UNREV1025), and 6.5 μl of DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix (2 ×) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The thermocycling protocol consisted of an initial activation step of 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 amplification cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 45 s at 72 °C, and a final extension step of 6 min at 72 °C. Five microliters of the amplified fragments were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis along with 100 bp DNA ladder. The DNA extracted from mosquito head-thoracic portion were used for qPCR identification of Plasmodium sporozoite infection. An multiplexed real-time qPCR assay was performed by using the published species-specific 18 s ribosomal RNA probes and primers for Plasmodium falciparum and P. malariae and P. ovale. Multiplexed qPCR was run on QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) in a final volume of 12 µl containing 2 µl of sample DNA, 6 µl of PerfeCTa qPCR ToughMix, Low ROX Master mix (2X) (Quantabio, Beverly, MA), 0.5 µl of each probe (2 µM), 0.4 µl of each forward primers (10 µM), 0.4 µl of each reverse primers (10 µM) and 0.1 µl of double-distilled water. The following temperature profile was applied: hold stage at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of PCR amplification stage at 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The standard curve of positive control containing Plasmid DNA (MRA-177 for P. falciprium, MRA-179 for P. malariae, and MRA-180 for P. ovale) from BEI Resources (https://www.beiresources.org) was included in each qPCR plate run with 3 negative controls. The CodonCode Aligner 9.0.1 (CodonCode Corporation, Centerville, MA) was used to check the sequence quality and trim low-quality bases. BioEdit software and MView web-based tool were used to conduct the alignment of the sequences and to calculate pairwise sequence identity and similarity from multiple sequence alignments. A threshold limit of 98% sequence similarity for ITS2 was used to classify sequences into species groups. The consensus sequences within group were compared to the NCBI nr/nt database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Sequence groups were assigned into known taxa or voucher specimen based on similarity to a voucher specimen sequence at 98% threshold value. The haplotypes of COX1 sequences were compared to both the NCBI nr/nt database and BOLD database (https://www.barcodinglife.org). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms with the General Time Reversible model for ITS2 consensus sequences of species groups and UPGMA with the Kimura 2-parameter model for COX1 haplotypes in the MEGA version 7.0. The tree nodes were evaluated by bootstrap analysis for 1000 replicates and rooted for COX1 haplotypes using a sequence from Aedes aegypti (GenBank: AF390098). The diversity index of Shannon and Simpson, as well as the Simpson’s evenness and dominance index were used to assess Anopheles diversity within and between sites. All these indices were calculated using PAST 4.0 software package. To compare diversity between highland and lowland, a t-test was used to determine whether they were significantly different. Human blood index (HBI) is defined as the proportion of freshly fed mosquitoes containing human blood and calculated as described by Garrett-Jones. Mixed blood meals were added to the number of each host blood meals when calculating the HBI separately. Sporozoite rate was estimated by the proportion of the number of positive individuals divided by total number of tested individuals with 95% confidence interval. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS JMP 14.0 software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).
The PDB structure of SARS-CoV2 main protease is available hence retrieved from RCSB (PDB number 5R82, resolution 1.31Å; PDB 6W63, resolution 2.1Å). Similarly, the SARS-CoV1 main protease (PDB number 5N19, Resolution 1.62), and MERS-CoV main protease (PDB number 5WKK, Resolution 1.55) were also retrieved from RCSB. Ligand interacting residue of the PDB structure was determined using maestro. The ligand was removed, and the unliganded PDB structure was pre-processed by assigning bond orders, adding hydrogens, creating zero-order bonds for metals, creating disulphide bonds, optimised for water orientation and pH, and minimised to 0.3RMSD using OPLS_2005 force field. Receptor grid was generated using the binding residues of the ligand as per our published protocol (Tiwari et al., 2019). Several hybrid combinations were generated using different parts of ritonavir, lopinavir, and remdesivir. The designed combinations were in-silico predicted for antiviral activity using the PASS online server as per our published method (Tiwari et al., 2018a). The hybrid antiviral molecules were prepared using LigPrep modules of the Schrodinger as per our published protocol (Tiwari et al., 2018b). All the prepared ligands were docked to the docking grid of the main protease of SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV in XP (Extra Precision) mode as per our published protocol (Verma and Tiwari, 2018). To get more accurate interaction, XP selected compounds were further subjected to molecular mechanics with generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations using Prime module of Schrodinger as per our published methods (Tiwari et al., 2019). MDS was performed using Desmond modules of the Schrodinger 2019-4 as per published methods (Wright et al., 2020). The protein-ligand complex was prepared and subjected to the system builder using the OPLS3e force field. The system was built for the protein-ligand complex using the TIP3P solvent model; sodium ion was added to make charge neutral, 0.15M NaCl was added to make the system close to the natural system. The simulation was run for 10ns, with 10ps trajectory recording intervals. System energy was set to be 1.2, and the ensemble class used was NPT. The simulation was set to run at 300k at 1.01325bar. The option to relax system before simulation was selected. The simulated system was analysed for the simulation interaction diagram. To produce synthetically tractable lead-like compounds, retrosynthetic analysis, and combinatorial synthesis was performed for 'VTRRT-13.V2′ hybrid antiviral molecule as per published method using PathFinder (Konze et al., 2019). In-silico enumeration provides a more exhaustive exploration of available chemical space than traditional empirical SAR studies. PathFinder can incorporate more than 100 reactions that are required for the molecular scaffolds and drug discovery (Bemis and Murcko, 1996). A total of 100 number of pathways are investigated to produce 10000 products. The top 10% product that are similar to the input molecule VTRRT-13.V2 were selected for further analysis. The selected 1000 products were analysed by docking, molecular mechanics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity analysis were carried out for the selected lead VTRRT-13.V2.1 using QikProp analysis as per our published protocol (Tiwari et al., 2020). Mutational sensitivity profiling of the Mpro was performed using the MAESTROweb as per the published method (Laimer et al., 2016). The amino acid sequence of Mpro was further analysed for any mutation which was originally present in the SARS-CoV2 virus using the CoV-GLUE database. The human off targets of the designed lead was predicted by Swiss Target Prediction using the published protocol (Tiwari et al., 2018a). In-silico cytotoxicity screening was performed using online CLC-Pred (Cell line Cytotoxicity Predictor) as per published protocol (Lagunin et al., 2018).
Genomic location position data of Homo sapiens microRNA hsa-miR-933 and protein-coding genes were retrieved from Ensembl (release 70) [26] database using the BioMart portal. We used the IntersectBed feature of the BEDTools [24] to find the host gene in which the hsa-miR-933 is embedded. We also cross-checked the promoter of the transcripts of hsa-miR-933 using the web portal http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/suppl/De_Rie_et_al_2017/ [21]. We have retrieved the tissue-wide expression data of the host gene ATF2 from NCBI Bioproject ID: PRJEB4337. Human miRNA tissue atlas [63] was used to obtain the gene expression data of hsa-miR-933 in different tissue types and bodily fluids. After identifying the host gene, we have identified the targets of the host gene. For this, ChIP-seq experiment datasets (Additional file 1) of the host gene were retrieved from the ENCODE database [64] for analysis. For target calling, we used the “closestBed” feature of the BEDTools [24] to identify the nearest transcript from the ChIP-seq peak as the target gene using Ensembl (release 70) transcripts. We have extracted the targets of hsa-miR-933 from several miRNA target gene databases which include both experimental and predicted targets, namely TargetScan v6.2 [6], TarBase v4 [65], PITA v6 [66], PicTar [67], experimentally validated miRTarBase v4.5 [68], miRBase [69], and miRecords v4 [70]. A commonly predicted miRNA target gene set was prepared from the targets retrieved from different microRNA target databases for further analysis. To find out the common targets of hsa-miR-933 and its host gene, we have conducted an overlap analysis using the interactive tool Venny (v 2.0.2) [71]. The result generated the list of targets that are both targeted by the host gene and hsa-miR-933. The functional annotation of target genes is based on Gene Ontology (GO) [72] as extracted from the Ensembl database (release 70) [26] and KEGG pathway database [73]. Accordingly, all genes are classified into the ontology categories biological process (GOBP), cellular component (GOCC), molecular function (GOMF), and pathways when possible. The GO/pathway categories that have at least 10 genes annotated were only considered. Gitools [74] was used for functional over-representation analysis and heatmap generation. Resulting p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamin and Hochberg’s method of false discovery rate (FDR) [75]. The host gene confers regulatory control by transcriptional or translational inhibition/activation of the hsa-miR-933 target genes or vice versa in possibly related biological processes or pathways. To test this hypothesis for all hosts and target genes, their respective annotations were compared and clustered manually based on the literature. Functional gene annotations as provided by the GO [72] and KEGG pathway [73] classify genes according to their molecular function, associated biological processes, or appearance within defined cellular components and pathways they appear. We have constructed the protein-protein interaction networks of enriched targets of the host gene and the miRNA hsa-miR-933 using tools STRING (version 10) [76] for possibly related biological processes or pathways. Based on protein-protein interaction, and data and knowledge-driven approach, the hypothesis for a particular enriched biological process or pathway was predicted. The whole workflow of this study is summarized in Additional file 6: Figure S1.
Human tissue specimens were surgically resected from a total of 144 LSCC patients at Gunma University Hospital from April 2001 to December 2014. In this study, the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and clinical data obtained during the follow-up duration ranging from 4 to 164 months (median, 41 months) were used. The tumor specimens were histologically classified according to the World Health Organization criteria, and the stages were defined using the International System for Staging Lung Cancer adopted by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union Internationale Centre le Cancer [18]. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and all patients provided written informed consent. The human LSCC cell lines, LK-2 and EBC-1 (National Institute of Biomedical Innovation/The Japanese Cancer Research Resource Bank, Osaka, Japan), NCI-H520 (American Type Culture Collection/ Summit Pharmaceuticals Intl. Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and RERF-LC-AI (Cell Engineering Division/RIKEN BioResource Research Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) were used. Cells were cultured in RPMI640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium). All cultured cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and maintained in continuous exponential growth by passaging. All cell lines were obtained from the reliable biobanks with authentication, mycoplasma test and short-tandem repeat (STR) profilings were performed in regular basis from the first culture of the cells to verify the cells to be the same as the cells registered. Cellular sensitivity to anticancer agents was evaluated by conventional in vitro CCK8 assay following the manufacturer’s protocol (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Exponentially growing cells (4.0 × 103 cells/well) were seeded in each well of 96-microwell plates with regular medium. After incubation for 24 h, the medium was replaced, and cells were exposed to various concentrations of docetaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Syracuse, NY), Cyramza/Ramucirumab (Eli Lilly-Japan, Kobe, Japan) and other cytotoxic drugs (cisplatin and 5-FU; Sigma Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) for 72 h. Then, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was added to each well for 2 h at 37 °C, and absorbance at 450 nm was determined using an xMark Microplate Absorbance Spectrophotometer (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). From the absorbance data, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Immuno-histochemical analysis was performed on FFPE LSCC sections. The sections were deparaffinized, blocked in protein block serum-free reagent (Dako, Carpentaria, CA) for 30 min, and incubated overnight with diluted primary antibodies at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. We used antibodies specific for STXBP4 (1:100 dilution; Abcam Japan, Tokyo, Japan), p53 (DO7, 1:50 dilution; Dako, Carpentaria, CA), TUBB3 (1:200 dilution; Abcam Japan, Tokyo, Japan) VEGFR2, STMN1 and PD-L1 (1:400 dilution, 1:400 dilution and 1:200 dilution; respectively; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Rabbit polyclonal ΔNp63 anti-body (1:100 dilution) was previously described [10, 11]. The reaction was visualized using the SignalStain® Boost IHC Detection Reagent (HRP, Rabbit; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO (Multi) Kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was applied as a 0.02% solution in 50 mM ammonium acetate citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.005% hydrogen peroxide. The sections were counterstained with Meyer’s hematoxylin (IHC World) and mounted. As negative control, the section was incubated without primary antibody to confirm its non-detectable staining [An additional file shows specificity information of each antibody and representative image of the controls (See Additional file 1)]. The expression levels of STXBP4 and ΔNp63 were scored using a semi-quantitative method: 1, ≤10%; 2, 11–25%; 3, 26–50%; 4, 51–75%; and 5, ≥76%. The percentage of STMN1 and TUBB3 staining was scored as follows: 1, ≤10%; 2, 11–25%; 3, 26–50%; and 4, ≥50%. The expression of VEGFR2 was considered positive only if distinct membrane staining was present, and was scored in the same manner as that used for STMN1 and TUBB3. For PD-L1, immunohistochemical staining was scored as 1, < 1%; 2, 1–5%; 3, 6–10%; 4, 11–25%; 5, 26–50%; and 6, > 50% of cells were positive. The tumors in which stained cancer cells were scored above 3 were defined as demonstrating high expression, with those scored 1 and 2 defined as demonstrating low expression. P53 microscopic examination of the nuclear reaction product was also undertaken and scored. P53 expression in > 10% of tumor cells was defined as positive expression. The sections were evaluated under a light microscope in a blinded fashion by at least two of the authors [An additional file shows representative image of the immune-histochemical scoring (See Additional file 2)]. Total RNA was prepared from cell lines LK-2 and RERF-LC-AI using NucleoSpin® RNA (Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan). The quality of the RNA was assessed by RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Agilent RNA6000 Pico Kit and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). High-quality RNA samples alone (RNA integrity numbers > 7.0) were used for genome-wide transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq experiments). Library preparation was performed using the TruSeq Standard mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) from 1 μg of total RNA, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The resulting libraries were subjected to paired-end sequencing using a NextSeq500 High Output v2 Kit and the Illumina NextSeq 500 system (43-base paired-end reads; Illumina). Data processing and analyses were performed using STAR v2.5.2b on the BaseSpace Sequencing Hub (Illumina). Briefly, reads were filtered, trimmed, and aligned against the UCSC human reference genome 19 (hg19) using a STAR pipeline. Normalization and differentially expressed genes were detected with TCC (Sun et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2013) package of R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. https://www.R-project.org/). Genes with a false-discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value < 0.05 were defined as being significantly modulated genes in LK-2 and RERF-LC-A1 cells. The networks and canonical pathways were generated through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbio-informatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis). Probability values (p value) < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. The Fisher exact test was used to examine the association between two categorical variables. The correlation between drug sensitivity and gene expression value was analyzed using the parametric Pearson’s product-moment correlation analysis. The correlation among target gene modulation and other modulations was analyzed using linear regression analysis. Follow-up for the 144 patients was conducted by reference to the patient medical records. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate survival as a function of time, and differences in survival were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazards model. Multivariate analyses were performed using a “survival” package in R software (Cox proportional hazards model to identify independent prognostic factors: R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. https://www.R-project.org/). Hierarchical clustering was performed by “hclust” from the stats package in R software. The day of surgery was defined as day 0 for measuring postoperative survival. OS was determined as the time from tumor resection to death from any cause. DFS was defined as the time between tumor resection and first disease progression or death. Statistical analysis was performed using R software.
Shale gas (five samples) and produced water (seven samples) from gas wellheads were collected with the help of trained industry technicians from horizontal gas wells in southeastern Sichuan Basin, China, in September 2015. Wells were drilled to a true vertical depth of 2700–4317 m with at least seven months of production. Water samples (3 L for each well) were collected into sterile polypropylene bottles with no headspace to avoid oxygen entering. Bottles were transported on ice to the laboratory once finishing sampling. Water samples were stored at 4 °C and processed within 24 h. Five gas samples (1 L for each well) were collected at the well sites through water displacement into inverted sterile bottles, which were subsequently sealed tightly underwater with butyl rubber stoppers to prevent oxygen entering. The pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen (DO) of the produced water were measured immediately on finishing sample collection in the field using a portable detector (Hach Company, Loveland, CO, USA). Samples for measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) were filtered through 0.22 μm syringe filters (EMD Millipore, MA, USA) before detection using Analytikjena multi N/C 3100 TOC/TNb Analyzer (Analytikjena, Jena, Germany). Cations and anions were measured according to Zhang et al., by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and Dionex inductively coupled plasma 2100 (ICP-2100) ion chromatogram (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), respectively. The chemical composition of shale gas was determined by Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) equipped with a HayeSep Q packing column and a thermal conductivity detector using He as the carrier gas. The stable isotopic ratios of CO2 and CH4 were measured by an online gas extraction system, Trace GC Ultra (Thermo Electron Corporation, TX, USA), a combustion furnace, and a ThermoQuest DeltaplusXL isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). The biomass in water samples (1 L) was concentrated onto 0.22 μm cellulose-ester filtering membranes (EMD Millipore, MA, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions after membrane shearing. 1% agarose gel electrophoresis was used to approximately check the purity and integrity of extracted DNA. The DNA concentration was examined using NanoDrop One Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Triplicate extracted DNA in the same volume from the three replicates was mixed into the final DNA which were then stored at -20 ℃ before sequencing. Genomic DNA of all the seven produced water samples were conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing, two of which extracted from water samples (W5 and W6) in two wells with different production period were picked to conduct metagenomic sequencing. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, bacterial V4–V5 region and archaeal V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified to generate PCR libraries. Primer sets and PCR conditions for bacterial and archaeal amplification are presented in Supplementary Information. After quantification with Qubit, the PCR libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq PE250 platform. For metagenomic sequencing of total DNA, the construction of sequencing libraries and the determination of the size distribution and concentration of purified products in libraries were performed according to Zhang et al. The sequencing of prepared libraries was performed on the Illumina HiSeq PE250 platform after generating clustered index-coded samples. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, raw paired-end reads were assigned to each sample according to its unique barcodes. After cutting of the barcodes and primers, paired-end reads were merged, and controlled quality. Then chimeras were detected and removed, and the effective tags were obtained to cluster into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity. Next, representative sequences were assigned into taxonomy compared with the GreenGene Database. The sequence data was normalized by extracting the least sequences of bacteria and archaea in each sample for alpha and beta diversity. Alpha diversity indices, including ACE and Chao indicating species richness, Shannon and Simpson indicating diversity, and Good’s coverage at 3% dissimilarity cut-off were calculated with QIIME. Statistical analyses were conducted to value the effects of individual geochemical factors on methanogenic microbes using Envfit in the Vegan package in R software (Version 3.2.0). The top four major geochemical factors influencing microbial distribution were displayed and combined with sequencing data to perform CCA. Detailed quality results and rarefaction curves (Supplementary Fig. S2 online) of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data (Supplementary Table S4 online) are shown in Supplementary Information. For metagenomic sequencing, all sequencing reads (raw data) were subjected to readfq (https://github.com/billzt/readfq) for quality control. The quality-controlled metagenomics reads (clean data) were assembled based on multiple k-mer method (k-mer size values of 49, 55 and 59) using MEGAHIT software (Version 1.0.4-beta). The obtained scaffolds, with maximum N50 assembled by contigs, were picked and fragmented to scaftigs. Additionally, clean data was mapped to scaftigs of each sample in order to obtain unassembled reads which were assembled and fragmented to scaftigs again. All the scaftigs (≥ 500 bp) were subjected to MetaGeneMark software (Version 2.10) for Open Reading Frame (ORF) prediction. Clean data were aligned to the predicted gene catalogues by Bowtie software (Version 2.24) and the genes with aligned reads number ≤ 2 were removed, which produced the unique genes used in the following process. For functional analyses, the unique genes were blasted against Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Version 2018–01). The abundance of annotated functional genes was calculated by summing the relative abundance of normalized corresponding unique genes. Detailed quality results and the features of the metagenomics sequencing data (Supplementary Table S5 online) are shown in Supplementary Information. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the abundance of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. In addition, we used qPCR to enumerate the (A) dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrB) genes using primers (Supplementary Table S3 online) that target both SRP; (B) methyl-coenzyme reductase (mcrA) genes using primers (Supplementary Table S3 online) that target methanogenic archaea. Methanogen-specific primers used to detect mcrA were able to evaluate all five proposed phylogenetic orders of archaea; therefore, the quantification results reflect the number of the majority of known methanogens. As the primer pair selected to enumerate the marker genes dsrB did not target all sulfate-reducing microorganisms, the results only represent the number of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) with low G + C Gram positive, SRB belong to δ-proteobacteria and Nitrospira division, and sulfate-reducing archaea (SRA). Quantification was performed in triplicate on DNA extracts using the ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Standard curves for bacteria, archaea, SRP and methanogens were generated from tenfold serial dilutions of plasmids containing 16S rRNA sequences or functional genes of Desulfosporosinus sp. (KC215425), Methanosarcina sp. (KC215420), Desulfovibrio sp. (DSM 642), and Methanosarcina sp. (KC244184) from clone libraries. Negative controls without DNA templates were performed for each qPCR assay, giving null or negligible values of copies. The detailed description about reaction conditions, primers, and standard curves of qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S3) are shown in Supplementary Information. Bottle experiments were conducted by mixing 2 volumes of produced water (mixture of an equal volume of water from all the wells) with 1 volume of anaerobic medium, amended with methanogenic substrates in 100 mL glass bottles. The bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and an open-hole screw cap. The anaerobic medium was prepared as previously described in an anaerobic glove box (Xinmiao YQX-11, Shanghai, China). Given that in situ methane could be utilized by microbes and therefore possibly influence methane production in the original reservoir environment, methane was initially added in the headspace of all the bottles at a ratio of 3 volumes CH4 to 2 volumes N2 (V/V; 1×105 Pa) in most bottles (except the bottles adding H2 + CO2). To determine the methane production potential, available methanogenic substrates were provided with acetate (50 mM), methanol (50 mM), H2 + CO2 (CH4/ H2 + CO2/ N2, 3/1/2, V/V/V; 1 ×105 Pa), or sodium molybdate (28 mM), a specific inhibitor of sulfate reduction. In addition, control group without methanogenic substrate but the same amount of deionized water was set up. To examine the effects of sulfate on methanogenesis, treatments under varied sulfate concentrations ranging from 9 mg/L to 466 mg/L were set up. Cultivations were performed in triplicate. All bottles were kept in the dark at 37 °C for 110 days. Methane production in the headspace was measured once two months using Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector, and was converted to micromoles (μmol) according to the ideal gas law, with standard pressures and temperatures. Samples for sulfide analysis on day 110 were fixed firstly with zinc acetate solution for preservation as zinc sulfide. Dissolved sulfide concentrations were subsequently determined by gas-phase molecular absorption spectrometry AJ-3000 plus (Shanghai ANJIE CO.LTD, Shanghai, China). Every two months, 1 mL liquid was transferred from the anaerobic bottles using a sterile syringe to prepare DNA extraction for qPCR of functional genes (mcrA and dsrB).
Seven-week-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice were purchased from the Animal Resource Centre (Perth, WA). Mice were acclimatised to the Florey Institute animal facility for 1 week prior to commencement of the study. Subsequently, animals were randomly allocated to either the subchronic stress group or control group. Male mice assigned to the subchronic stress group were provided drinking water supplemented with corticosterone hemisuccinate (25 mg/L; Steraloids Inc, RI, USA) that was prepared twice weekly, as previously published. Mice comprising the control group received untreated filtered tap water. Food and fluids were provided ad libitum. Mice were housed in the Florey Institute animal facility in a room maintained at 22–25 °C/55% humidity on a 12:12H light–dark cycle (lights on at 0700H). Male and female breeders were single housed in cages with wood chip bedding and provided tissue paper as nesting material prior to paired matings. After 7 days of treatment, mice were pair-mated for 3 days to generate the F1 offspring during which time untreated water was provided. Treated mice that were not pair-mated were used for behavioural testing, serum assays and gene expression profiling studies. After the pairing period, females were separated into single-housing and left undisturbed apart from weekly box changes until they littered down. F1 offspring were weaned at 28 days of age and sex-sorted into groups of 3–5 mice per cage within each paternal treatment group. They were left to age undisturbed until 8 weeks of age when behavioural testing commenced. Tests were performed in a room different from the housing room. All mice were allowed to acclimatize to the testing room for at least 30 min prior to commencement of each test. Testing was conducted between 0800 and 1300 h and under dimmed lighting of 30–50 lx. Animals were tested in a randomised order with the experimenter blind to the paternal condition. The sequence of tests was the same for all subjects. Elevated-plus maze was performed as previously described. Briefly, maze arms were 30 cm in length and 5 cm in width, and the closed arms had walls of 14 cm height. The activity pattern of each mouse over 5 min was automatically tracked from overhead using the CleverSys TopScan software (Reston, VA, USA). Total time spent in the open arms was expressed as a percentage of the test duration. Light–dark box was performed as previously described. Briefly, the test was conducted using the Med Associates ENV-510/511 open-field arenas (Fairfax, VT, USA). The light compartment was illuminated with overhead LED lamps to 750 lx. Mice started each 10-min test session in the dark insert. Time spent in each half of the arena was automatically tabulated by the proprietary activity monitor software and expressed as a percentage of the test duration. Novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) was performed as previously described. Briefly, mice were food-deprived for 48 h with a 1 h feeding period after the first 24 h. Mice were weighed on the morning of the NSFT to calculate % body weight loss, with an expected weight loss of at least 15%. All mice met this criterion. Testing was conducted under dimmed lighting of 25 lx in a 30 × 30 × 30 cm novel arena lined with clean bedding with a food pellet in the centre. The latency for the mouse to assume a stationary posture while feeding on the pellet was recorded. When this occurred, the mouse was immediately removed and placed into a clean cage containing a pre-weighed food pellet for 10 min. The amount consumed during that period was recorded. All mice were then returned to their original boxing configurations with ab libitum food and water access. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation and trunk blood was collected. For the gene expression studies, mice were killed for brain dissections at 2 distinct points of the day/light cycle (+ 3 h lights on ~ 10am and + 3 h lights off ~ 10 pm). Brains were immediately removed from the skull and the hypothalamus was fresh dissected on ice, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then transferred to storage at − 80 °C until further use. Whole blood was left to clot for 30 min before separation of serum by centrifugation at 1100 g for 15 min, which was stored at − 20 °C until subsequent analysis. Corticosterone concentrations were assayed using an EIA as per manufacturer’s instructions (#501320, Caymen Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). ACTH concentrations were determined by a commercial service provider (Cardinal Bio-Research, New Farm, QLD, Australia) using a Millipore Luminex platform with the MILIPLEX MAP mouse bone panel (MBNMAG-41K). One control sample from the ‘lights on + 3 h’ group failed and was excluded from the analysis. Cauda epididymides were separated from the corpus segment and the epididymal fat pad was removed, leaving only the vas deferens attached. The cauda epididymides were bisected with a single incision then immersed into 1 mL of M2 medium (M7167, Sigma-Aldrich, NSW, Australia) pre-warmed to 37 °C. After at least 30 min incubation at 37 °C, tissue was discarded and spermatozoa were resuspended. An aliquot was removed and stained with Trypan Blue for the purpose of cell counting. Sperm were pelleted and archived at − 80 °C for separate studies. The SV40-immortalized mouse caput epididymal epithelial (mECap18) cell line was provided as a kind gift from Dr. Petra Sipila (Turku University, Turku, Finland). mECap18 cells were cultured in DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose) supplemented with 100 μM sodium pyruvate, 200 μM L-glutamate, 100 U/mL penicillin, 10 μg/mL streptomycin, and 10% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum with 50 nM 5α-androstan-17β-ol3-one with passaging as required. Cells were plated and allowed to grow for 72 h prior to treatment with 100 nM 4-pregnen-11β, 21-diol-3, 20-dione 21-acetate (Q1570-000, Steraloids Inc, Rhode Island, USA) for up to 10 days with media replacement occurring at intervals of 48 h. Following treatment, cells were harvested at days 3, 5, 7 and 10 prior to performing RNA extraction. Briefly, total RNA was isolated by homogenisation of mECap18 cells in Solution D (4M guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% sarkosyl, 0.72% 2-mercaptoethanol). RNA was subsequently extracted using a standard phenol/chloroform protocol before being precipitated with isopropanol. The RNA pellet was then redissolved in Solution D and precipitated with ethanol. Finally, the pellet was air dried and dissolved in RNase-free water. Whole epididymides were dissected from an independent group of CORT treated and control mice, and trisected to obtain the caput, corpus and cauda segments of the epididymides. These were frozen on dry ice then stored at − 80 °C. Frozen tissue was homogenised in a cold RIPA buffer (10 mM tris pH 7.5, 80 mM NaCl, 0.5% IGEL-PAL, 0.05% SDS, 0.3% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, Cat# P8340)) with sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant concentration was determined using the Pierce Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Cat# 23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific). 30 µg of protein was then loaded into each lane of a 10% SDS PAGE gel. After protein separation, the proteins were transferred on to a PVDF membrane and blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer solution (LI-COR Biotechnology, Cat# 927-40000) for 30 min. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (Cat# HPA004248, Rabbit anti-NR3C1 antibody, Sigma-Aldrich; Cat# 4967, mouse β-Actin antibody, Cell Signalling) in the blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies used for detecting signals were IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Secondary Antibody and IRDye 680LT Goat anti-Mouse IgG Secondary Antibody (Licor). Total relative protein abundances were determined using the Pierce Reversible Protein Stain Kit (Cat# 24580, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blots were analysed by Image Studio Lite (Version 5.2.5) and ImageJ ver 1.52q. Data was expressed as a percentage of the maximum signal of the target protein on each membrane. Frozen hypothalamus tissue was homogenised in Qiazol lysis buffer using a Diagenode bioruptor (UCD-300, Liege, Belgium), then total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kits as per the manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN, Chadstone, VIC, Australia), including on-column DNaseI digestion. Concentration and quality of the eluted RNA was determined using Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser Nanochips (Cat# 5067; Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA, USA). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Invitrogen Superscript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Cat#11754050; Life Technologies Australia). The cDNA was then diluted 50 × prior to qPCR. Primer sequences were as previously published. qPCR reactions were performed in an Agilent Biosystems ViiA7 platform using technical triplicates. For the in vitro study on mECap18 cells, total RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (M6101; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to remove genomic contamination. 2 μg of total RNA was then reverse transcribed using 500 ng oligo dT, 5 × buffer, 100 mM DTT, 40 U of rRNasin (N2111; Promega, NSW, Australia), 0.5 mM dNTPs, and 20 U of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (M1701; Promega, NSW, Australia). Primer sequences were as follows: NR3C1, forward (5′ GAGGACAACCTGACTTCCTTGGG 3′), reverse (5′ GTGGTCCCGTTGCTGTGGA 3′) and cyclophilin, forward (5′ CGTCTCCTTCGAGCTGTTT 3′), reverse (5′ ACCCTGGCACATGAATCCT 3′). Real-time analysis was performed on a Roche Light Cycler 96 SW 1.1 using Promega GoTaq qPCR mastermix (M7122; Promega, NSW, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each data set represents 3 independent replicates of treated cells. All PCR products were sequenced to ensure correct sequence amplification. Cyclophilin was used as the endogenous reference gene. Relative gene expression was calculated using the -∆∆CT method. Data was analysed in Graphpad Prism (v8.3.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) or Ryy. Unpaired t-tests were used to analyse the physiological parameters and behavioural data for male breeders. 2-way ANOVA was used to analyse the hypothalamus and serum data sets with ‘treatment’ and ‘time’ as the fixed between-subject factors. Sidak post hoc testing, where appropriate, incorporated corrections for multiple comparisons. Offspring behavioural data was analysed by linear mixed models with ‘sex’ and ‘paternal treatment’ as fixed between-subject factors effects and ‘litter’ as random effect. If there were significant main or interaction effects, post hoc pairwise comparisons were computed from the contrasts between factors using the lsmeans package with Tukey adjustments. To meet the assumptions of parametric analysis, the Shapiro–Wilk test was applied. All main effects and interaction terms were tested on local significance level α = 0.05. Graphs were created using GraphPad Prism. All animal experiments were approved by the Florey Institute Animal Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia guidelines and the Australian code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes.

SeqAcademy uses self-contained tutorials, which runs Python, R, and Bash scripts among others, all from the document itself. It requires about 16 GB of memory storage. The tutorial files facilitate open science and reproducible code by mixing code chunks with notes and markup. This format, known as “literate programming,” is particularly amenable to teaching bioinformatics because it allows learners to follow along in the document while running each code step directly within the notebook. The tutorial begins with an explanation of how to install necessary dependencies and select interesting data from the
BioProjects browser. Alignment while streaming the data is done with
HISAT2 version 0.1.6 and subsequent quality control with
MultiQC version 1.5. The tutorial then splits into two separate protocols: one for RNA-seq, the other for ChIP-seq analysis. The workflow involved setup, alignment, quality control, analysis, and visualization steps for publicly available RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq data sets. There are many appropriate tools available for each step of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis. Our goal is to present an easy to use and understandable pipeline rather than an exhaustive list of analysis tools. For each step below, we will explain the role of the bioinformatic tool, as well as our rationale for including it in this tutorial pipeline (
Figure 1). Here, we present an overview of the steps; further details for each subsection can be found on the
project’s Github page. The setup step uses the
Bioconda channel (
Grüning
) for the conda package manager to install all of the programmatic dependencies for the entire pipeline. The data sets were selected by searching NCBI BioProject web browser (
Barrett
). For our use case, we searched for publically available RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets that were relatively small and thus could be easily downloaded and processed, and would be relatively straightforward to interpret biologically. We therefore selected RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data from yeast (
Saccharomyces cerevisiae) samples (
Mulla
;
Rawal
). The RNA-seq data demonstrates the differences in genetic expression between aneuploid and euploid yeast (
Mulla
). The ChIP-seq data demonstrates the effects of 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) on chromatin accessibility (
Rawal
). We downloaded the reference sequence for
Saccharomyces cerevisiae from
Ensembl version 84 (RNA-seq SRA study number:
SRP106028 ChIP-seq SRA study number:
SRP132584). We note that the
SraRunTables file can be adjusted to specific user data, different from the RNA-seq or ChIP-seq data sets used in this project. Thus, this lightweight, portable educational pipeline can be adapted to meet the usage needs and interests of a broad base of bioinformatics beginners and teachers. The purpose of alignment, map raw sequence reads to a reference genome, thereby allowing quantification of a genomic property (e.g. gene transcription in the case of RNA-seq). HISAT2 is a software program used for the alignment of raw sequence data, consisting of FASTQ files (
Kim
. We chose to use HISAT2 because it allows users to stream raw sequence data rather than downloading it to the local machine, reducing disk space and time requirements for users of the SeqAcademy educational tool - an exemplary use of “edge-computing” in bioinformatics. One disadvantage of this approach is that it requires a stable internet connection, as the aligned raw sequence files are downloaded as SAM (sequence alignment mapping) files along with the log files. Nevertheless, by choosing to use HISAT2 for alignment, we reduced required disk space and broadened the potential user base of this pipeline. Quality control is a critical step given that sequencing data is often of heterogeneous quality, and is a way of i) identifying outliers ii) assessing whether sequencing data is a valid measure of a genomic property To generate a quality control report about the success of the alignment, we used MultiQC (
Ewels
). MultiQC reports the number of reads mapped to one unique location, reads mapped to multiple unique locations, and reads not mapped to any location in the reference genome. MultiQC can provide reports for both RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq data. Reads mapped to one unique location have a higher confidence level of being correctly mapped, as reads mapped to multiple unique locations cannot be localized to the reference with a high degree of probability. While MultiQC is not strictly necessary for this pipeline--the plots and statistics it produces are based off of the HISAT2 alignment summary files - we chose to include it to introduce users to a useful tool that is built for quality control. RNA-sequencing is a high throughput method for studying gene transcription. After alignment and quality control, users convert the SAM files to BAM files with the
samtools package version 1.8 (
Li
). Then, gene expression is quantified with
HTSeq version 0.9.1 (
Anders
). Quantification of gene expression is important for understanding transcript abundance and for making statistical comparisons of gene expression between groups. Afterwards, we demonstrate how to extract biological significance from these various analyses, by showing students how to visualize gene expression patterns and undertake exploratory data analysis with principal component analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised clustering method best suited for studies including multiple samples. If only one RNA-seq sample is present, PCA is not an appropriate analysis as no dimensional reduction can be performed. For multiple samples with a single condition, PCA is a valuable tool for identifying and quantifying potential batch effects. When batch effects are successfully isolated by PCA, the corresponding batch PCs may be valuable as adjustment variables (i.e. covariates) in downstream analysis. For example, including batch PCs as covariates in differential gene expression analysis can help reduce confounding by batch. For multiple samples with multiple conditions, PCA can potentially distinguish groups and determine how much transcriptome-wide variance the condition explains. Notably, PCA offers a global picture of transcription and cannot determine which specific genes are different between conditions--individual genes are best identified via differential gene expression analysis (see DESeq2 below). Likewise, PCA may again be useful in this scenario for quantifying batch effects. Lastly, PCA of multiple samples can be used for as an additional quality control step with visual identification of outliers. Finally, we show how to undertake differential expression analysis using
DESeq2 version 1.21.0 (
Love
) and how to visualize these differences with volcano plots and experiment-specific visualizations in the R package
ggplot2 version 2.2.1 (
Wickham, 2009). Thus, students can learn how to quantify gene expression, answer biologically relevant questions through differential gene expression analysis, and visualize gene expression patterns. After alignment, we perform peak-calling to determine protein-binding locations in the ChIP-seq data. The peak-calling step of ChIP-Seq involves finding differentially binding sites between the two ChIP-Seq signals (input and immunoprecipitate). Numerous peak callers exist to distinguish biologically relevant signal peaks from technical noise for the Chip-Seq experiments. Here, we used the peak-calling algorithm
MACS (Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq) version 1.4.2 (
Zhang
). MACS is a commonly used peak-caller and has been shown to have more accurate results than competing peak-callers (
Hocking
). After calling peaks, the results are sorted and analyzed for intersections using
bedtools version 2.27.0, a set of tools for analyzing genomic data (
Quinlan & Hall, 2010) with the genes annotated. Bedtools provides a set of tools for common genomics analysis techniques. It’s straightforward and popular within the field of bioinformatics. Lastly, bedtools output is visualized with
Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) version 2.4, a genomic data set viewer that allows for visualization of genomic features (
Robinson
).
Anaplasma phagocytophilum isolate NCH-1, obtained from BEI resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was used in all studies involving in vivo work with ticks and mice; wherever necessary, NCH-1 isolate is referred as A. phagocytophilum. Maintenance of A. phagocytophilum was carried out in HL-60 (ATCC, CCL-240) cells as described. Host cell-free A. phagocytophilum-DC was isolated from confluent > 70% HL-60 infected cells by sonication followed by differential centrifugation as described. Briefly, infected HL-60 cells were centrifuged at 2300 g for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellet was re-suspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by sonication (8 s bursts with 8 s resting periods) on ice and then passaged 6–8 times through 27 ½ gauge syringe needle. This sonicated lysate was processed further for differential centrifugation to separate the bacterial DC form from the host cells that included 750 g spin for 5 min to pellet host cell debris and centrifuging the supernatant again at 1000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 2300 g for 10 min. The pellet obtained is composed of host cell-free A. phagocytophilum-DC. 1× PBS was added to resuspend this pellet and used for further analysis. Wherever necessary A. phagocytophilum-DC is referred as Ap-DC. MRPS is based on coulter principle using a microfluidic cartridge and can be utilized to analyze particle sizes from 50 to 2000 nm in a solution. We performed MRPS (nCS1, Spectradyne LLC, USA) on host cell-free A. phagocytophilum-DC to determine the size and concentration of DC particles. Infection in HL-60 cells was maintained as described. Briefly, two cell culture flasks with 10 ml each containing approximately 1 × 106/ml infected HL-60 cells were centrifuged and processed for DC form isolation as described in the previous section. Equal number of uninfected HL-60 cells was processed as control group. Final DC pellet was re-suspended in 500 μl of 1 × PBS. Control tube used for processing uninfected HL-60 cells was also treated with the same volume of 1 × PBS. Three microliters from both suspensions were processed for MRPS Spectradyne measurements. All samples were measured at − V = − 5.0 V and + V = + 6.0 V using factory calibrated TS-2000 cartridge: ~ 250–2000 nm particle size range. MRPS Spectradyne measurements are plotted to show particle size (concentration/ml) on Y-axis and particle diameter (nm) on the X-axis (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S1). The ± numbers actually mean counting error. There are 2 error numbers, the first is negative error and the second is positive error. The values are calculated based on Poisson-distributed statistics, and assumption that particles arrive at the nano-constriction in a purely random fashion (i.e. no particle event is related to another, they all occur independently). The statistical counting error was calculated based upon 1/√(N) (1 divided by square root of N), where N is the number of particles counted. When using Resistive Pulse Sensing to make particle measurements there is always electrical noise in the system. All the blue dots (Supplementary Fig. S1) that go across bottom of the transit time scatterplot are purely noise and they were excluded from the analysis. Laboratory reared I. scapularis (larvae and nymphs) ticks obtained from a continuously maintained tick colony from BEI resources/Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or National Tick Research and Education Resource, Oklahoma State University were used in this entire study. C3H/HeN mice (female mice, 4–6 weeks old, CharlesRiver Laboratories, USA) were used in all animal experiments in this study. Uninfected nymphs were generated by feeding larvae on naïve mice and were allowed to molt into nymphs. Tick rearing was conducted in an incubator at 23 ± 2 °C with 90–95% relative humidity and a 14/10 h light/dark photoperiod regiment, as described in our previous studies. DC-injected (via anal pore microinjection) unfed nymphal ticks (freshly molted) were fed on naïve C3H/HeN mice to transmit A. phagocytophilum from ticks to mice (Fig. 1). Upon repletion, these fed nymphal ticks were processed for DNA extractions followed by PCR to detect A. phagocytophilum loads. After day seven-post infection in C3H/HeN mice, larvae were allowed to feed on the same mice (generated by feeding with DC-injected ticks) for pathogen acquisition into ticks (Fig. 1). Upon repletion, these fed larvae were processed for DNA extraction, followed by PCR to detect A. phagocytophilum loads. After larval repletion, mice were euthanized and blood, liver and spleen were collected and processed for DNA extractions, followed by PCR to detect A. phagocytophilum (Fig. 1). In addition, a group of repleted larval ticks that were fed on DC-injected-tick-mediated infected mice were allowed to molt to nymphs (Fig. 1). DNA was extracted from molted nymphs and processed for PCR to detect bacterial loads. Schematic representation of microinjection of A. phagocytophilum-DC forms in Ixodes scapularis ticks.

This image was Created with BioRender.com. All animal work in this study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. The Old Dominion University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, Animal Welfare Assurance Number: A3172-01) approved protocols 16-017 and 19-009 were used in mice experiments. Acepromazine Maleate injection, USP (2 μl from 10 mg/ml stock/30 g mouse) tranquilizer was administered to the animals prior to handling to minimize anxiety and/or discomfort, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. The Eppendorf FemtoJet microinjection system was used in this study. Microinjections into ticks were performed as previously described. The DC preparation (as described in an earlier methods section) from A. phagocytophilum-infected HL-60 was tenfold serially diluted twice and the diluted solution was used for microinjections into ticks. Micoinjections were performed into the anal pore of uninfected unfed nymphs (~ 4.2 nl/tick). During microinjection ticks were temporarily immobilized on a double-sided tape. Microinjected ticks were incubated at room temperature for seven days for acclimatization in an incubator at 23 ± 2 °C with 90–95% relative humidity and a 14/10 h light/dark photoperiod. After 7 days of incubation, DC-microinjected ticks were fed on naïve C3H/HeN mice to transmit the pathogen. Approximately, out of 20 ticks that were placed on mice, 8–10 DC-microinjected ticks successfully fed and repleted from each mouse. Repleted ticks were processed for DNA extraction followed by quantification of A. phagocytophilum p44 loads by QRT-PCR/PCR using oligonucleotides as mentioned in Table S1. The PCR conditions for QRT-PCR/PCR are mentioned in the QRT-PCR and PCR analysis section. In non-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Quantitative Real-Time-PCR (QRT-PCR) experiments, DNA was used to detect presence or absence of bacteria. For reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RNA was used to detect presence or absence of bacterial transcripts. To detect bacteria loads in ticks, genomic DNA from A. phagocytophilum-infected (DC-injected) unfed or fed nymphs or fed larvae or molted unfed nymphs and mice samples were extracted using DNeasy Blood and tissue kit (QIAGEN) and processed for PCR with primers specific for A. phagocytophilum p44 gene as mentioned in Table S1. As an internal control, I. scapularis ribosomal 5.8s rRNA was analyzed in the same DNA samples using oligonucleotides as mentioned in Supplementary Table S1. Total RNA from A. phagocytophilum DC was generated using the Aurum Total RNA mini kit (Bio-Rad, USA) and following the manufacturer instructions. During RNA extraction, on-column DNase I digestion was performed as per manufacturer’s recommendation. The eluted RNA was then converted to cDNA using BioRAD cDNA synthesis kit (BioRAD, USA). The generated cDNA was used as a template for the detection of A. phagocytophilum transcripts (dnaA and dnaK) using the oligonucleotides shown in Supplementary Table S1. In DNA samples extracted from murine blood and tissue samples, bacterial burden was quantified by normalizing the level of A. phagocytophilum p44 to mice beta-actin levels using oligonucleotides mentioned in Table S1. QRT-PCR was performed as described using CFX96 QRTPCR machine (BioRad, USA), iQ-SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, USA) and with DNA samples isolated from murine tissues. In QRT-PCR reactions, the standard curve for each gene fragment was generated using tenfold serial dilutions starting from 1 ng to 0.00001 ng of known quantities of respective fragments. For standard preparation, initial DNA concentration was measured by taking optical density reading in TECAN plate reader (TECAN, USA). After measurements of concentrations, tenfold serial dilutions were made to prepare various standards. PCR reactions were performed with Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., USA). The PCR conditions were modified from and were used for both QRT-PCR and PCR. The conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 5 min initial denaturation followed by 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 40 cycles with final extension of 72 °C for 7 min. For RT-PCR, following conditions were used: 94 °C for 2 min 30 s initial denaturation followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 34 cycles with final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR or RT-PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Internal quality control included parallel PCR amplification of no template control (ntc) and positive control (+, previously sequenced fragment) along with the samples. PCR products obtained from A. phagocytophilum specific oligonucleotides from every experimental group including murine blood, DC-injected fed nymphs (from transmission experiment), fed larvae (from acquisition experiment) and molted nymphs (from transstadial transmission experiment), were gel purified and sequenced at Eurofins (USA). Statistical significance in the data sets was analyzed using GraphPad Prism6 software (https://www.graphpad.com/) and Microsoft Excel 2010 (https://www.microsoft.com). For data to compare two means, the non-paired Student’s t-test was performed. P values of < 0.05 were considered significant in all analyses. Wherever necessary, statistical test and P values used are reported.
Adult male Wistar rats (aged 3 months, weighing ~ 220 g) were obtained from Toxi-Coop (Budapest, Hungary). Rats were housed under standard laboratory conditions (lights on at 9:00 AM, lights off at 9:00 PM) in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms with ad libitum access to food and water. All animal care and experimental procedures were in accordance with the Council Directive 86/609/EEC, the Hungarian Act of Animal Care and Experimentation (1998, XXVIII). They were carried out in strict compliance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU regarding the care and use of laboratory animals for experimental procedures. All the procedures conformed to the National Institutes of Health guidelines were in accordance with the guidelines of the local Animal Care and Use Committee and were approved by the local Ethical Committee of Gedeon Richter Plc. All efforts were carried out to minimize the animals’ pain and suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. The animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups and we assured the experimenters’ blindness to the animal groups whenever possible. A total of 24 rats were used (4 for electrophysiological and 20 for proteomic investigations (n = 14 for CCH and n = 6 for sham operation)) in the experiments. Stepwise bilateral common carotid artery occlusion was performed on rats as previously described. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2% in air) and a ventral midline incision was placed on the neck. In the first step, the left common carotid artery was exposed, gently separated from the vagus nerve, and occluded by three ligatures (2-0). After surgery, the animals recovered and were taken to their home cages. In the second step, one week later, the same surgical procedure was performed on the right common carotid artery. Rats in the control group underwent a sham operation as they received the same surgical procedures in both steps, but only a thread was placed around the vessels without ligation of the arteries. Figure 4 shows the experimental arrangement of the proteomic study. Experimental arrangement of proteomic study. Between the ligature of the left and right carotid artery, animals had one week of regeneration. MRA measurements were performed 2 and 5 weeks after the second occlusion. Animals were sacrificed and three brain structures were isolated from each rat 8 weeks after the second occlusion. Finally, synaptosomes were prepared from the 3 isolated brain regions and 2-D DIGE experiments were conducted. The surgical procedure and electrophysiological recordings were carried out on 4 rats as previously described elsewhere. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2% in air) and the skin over the skull was cut in the midline. For recording EEG and VEP, stainless steel screw electrodes were implanted above the right parietal and both primary visual cortices (1 mm lateral from the sagittal suture and 1 mm rostral from the lambdoid suture) and the cerebellar hemispheres (as ground electrodes). For the ERG recordings, we placed a broom-like stainless steel wire over the posterior part of the left eye beneath the upper eyelid. A stainless-steel plate serving as a reference electrode was implanted between the temporal muscle and the skin next to the left ear (Supplementary Fig. S1). All electrodes were soldered to an 8-pin socket that was cemented on the skull together with a stimulus LED connected to a separate 2-pin socket. The red light-emitting LED (maximum emission at 651 nm) was fixed behind the left eye, so the ERG was not influenced by the size of the pupil or by the position of the eye (retrobulbar light stimulation). The rats were allowed a recovery period of 2–3 days before ERG and VEP experiments. Data were recorded on freely moving, dark-adapted rats in a Faraday cage using a BioAmp amplifier (Supertech, Pécs, Hungary) with 0.3 Hz–10 kHz bandpass filtering, a BioStim stimulator (Supertech) and a CED Micro1401-3 data acquisition system (Cambridge, UK) with Signal 4.10 software (Cambridge, UK). We recorded 5 s long frames every 20 s and applied 5 ms long light flashes with 0.1 s prestimulus time (sampling frequency: 15 kHz). The experiment was self-controlled, 50 frames were averaged per trial and we recorded 4–6 trials altogether on 2–3 different days before the first occlusion and 1, 5, and 10 days after the second occlusion. Data were analyzed using the Signal 4.10 and OriginPro 8.5 software by calculating the b-wave area of the ERG and the major negative peak area of the VEP (N peak) recorded from the right primary visual cortex (Supplementary Fig. S1). To examine the fast OP components of the ERG signals, we applied an FFT high pass filter at 40 Hz and calculated the area of the ERG OPs (Supplementary Fig. S1). The changes in VEP, ERG, and OP areas were calculated as the percentage of control results; data are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The statistical analysis was performed by comparing the areas of the signals recorded before and 1, 5, and 10 days after the BCCAO procedure. Friedman ANOVA test was applied (α = 0.05) since the data are not normally distributed and the experimental design is based on repeated measures. The efficacy of the occlusions was confirmed with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) twice for the proteomic experiment based on our previous study. Two and 5 weeks after the second occlusion, anesthetized animals were scanned in a 9.4 T MRI system (Varian, Medical Systems Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a free bore of 210 mm, containing a 120 mm inner size gradient coil. A 72 mm diameter quadrature-driven birdcage coil (Rapid Biomedical, Rimpar, Germany) was used for RF excitation, and a dedicated 4 channel phased array coil was used for signal reception (Rapid Biomedical). Three-dimensional time-of-flight (TOF) angiography (3D gradient echo) was performed at TR/TE = 40/3 ms, resolution = 0.42 × 0.42 × 0.46 mm. The MRA studies were performed to evaluate cervical and intracranial arteries and parenchymal injury. At 5 weeks an additional T2 weighted anatomical scan was performed (fast spin echo, TR/TE = 15.8 s/28.8 ms, echo train length = 8, matrix = 128 × 128, slices = 150, resolution = 0.17 × 0.17 × 0.2 mm, 8 averages). The MRI recording shown in Fig. 1 was taken 5 weeks after the second occlusion. Experimental animals that were assigned for further experiments had to meet the criteria as follows: (1) lack of gross anatomical abnormalities (i.e., pathologically large or asymmetrical anatomical structures) (2) lack of extensive lesions or any sign of extended tissue impairment. The T2 weighted anatomical scan revealed ischemic lesions in none of the animals; however, one BCCAO rat was euthanized and excluded from the experiment due to the deterioration of its condition. Seven weeks after the second occlusion, rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2% in air), and the animals were sacrificed. Their brains were quickly removed from their skulls and rinsed in dry ice-cooled artificial cerebrospinal fluid to remove blood contamination. The cerebral cortices from both hemispheres were separated, then the left hippocampi and the frontal and occipital cortices were dissected on dry ice powder. First, the isolated brain was placed on a pre-cooled Petri dish and cut into two halves in the mid-sagittal plane. A blade was used to cut the anterior part of the brain approximately at the anterior end of the corpus callosum and the frontal cortices were isolated using two forcipes. Subsequently, the hippocampi from both hemispheres were removed using two forcipes. Finally, the occipital cortices at the posterior part of the brain (covering the hippocampus and extending back to the posterior end of the cerebral cortex) were isolated from the inner structures. The subcellular fractionations were performed immediately after the dissections. The fraction of synaptosomes was prepared following precisely the protocol published by Phillips et al. and Hahn et al.. Briefly, brain tissues were homogenized in a homogenization solution (320 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and homogenized with a Dounce Tissue Grinder (Sigma-Aldrich) manually (40 strokes per sample) at 4 °C with pre-cooled solution and equipment. The sucrose concentration was adjusted to 1.25 M, 1 M sucrose, 0.1 mM CaCl2 solution was layered on top of the homogenate, and the samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000×g for 3 h. After ultracentrifugation, synaptosomes were collected from the interface between the two sucrose layers and the proteins were acetone-precipitated overnight at -20 °C. Proteins were resuspended in a lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mM Tris, 5 mM magnesium-acetate) and stored at -80 °C. The high-throughput investigation of the proteome of the synaptosome samples (6 sham-operated, 6 BCCAO) was performed using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE). For the separate analysis of the hippocampus, frontal and occipital cortices, three individual runs with 6-6 gels were performed. The samples were adjusted to pH 8.5 and their protein concentration was determined by the 2D-Quant kit (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The fluorescent labeling of the proteins was conducted with a CyDye DIGE Fluor Minimal dye labeling kit (GE Healthcare). Fifty micrograms of proteins of each sample from CCH-treated and control rats were randomly labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dyes, while the reference sample (internal standard containing equal protein amounts (25 μg)) was labeled with Cy2. The differently labeled samples were mixed and rehydrated passively onto Immobiline DryStrip gel strips (24 cm, pH 3–10 NL, GE Healthcare) overnight. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed in an Ettan IPGphor 3 IEF unit for 24 h to attain a total of 100 kVh (GE Healthcare). Following IEF, the proteins were reduced and carbamidomethylated using an equilibration buffer containing 1% mercaptoethanol and 2.5% iodoacetamide, respectively. SDS-PAGE separation was performed on 24 × 20 cm, 10% polyacrylamide gels in an Ettan DALTsix Electrophoresis System (GE Healthcare). Then, the gels were scanned with a TyphoonTRIO+ scanner (GE Healthcare) using appropriate lasers and filters with the photomultiplier tube (PMT) biased at 600 V. Differential protein analysis was performed using the DeCyder software package (GE Healthcare), employing its Differential Analysis (DIA) and Biological Variance Analysis (BVA) modules. The fluorescence intensities of the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes on a particular gel were normalized to the intensity of the Cy2 dye. Quantitation of the fluorescence intensities of the protein spots and statistical analyses were carried out using the software. Statistically significantly altered protein spots (P < 0.05 using independent, two-tailed Student’s t-test) with more than ± 1.15 fold changes (FC) were picked for further protein identification. For the identification of proteins in spots of interest, preparative 2-D gel electrophoresis was performed separately using a total of 800 μg of synaptic proteins per gel. Resolved protein spots were visualized by the Colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 stain (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). One preparative gel for each brain region was run, and the selected spots were manually excised from the gels with pipette tips for protein identification. Excised spots were placed in 1% acetic acid solution. Proteins in the selected 2-D gel spots were in-gel digested as described in the protocol available on-line (https://msf.ucsf.edu/protocols.html). Briefly, gel spots were cut to smaller cubes, washed with 25 mM ammonium-bicarbonate/50% acetonitrile, reduced using 10 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide. After dehydration, the gel pieces were rehydrated with 100 ng Trypsin (sequencing grade, side-chain-protected porcine trypsin, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 20 µl of 25 mM ammonium-bicarbonate. Samples were digested for 4 h at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were extracted and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Samples were reconstructed in 20 µl of 0.1% formic acid before mass spectrometric analysis. Five µl of digest was injected for LC–MS/MS analyses onto an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) mass spectrometer on-line coupled with a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). In order to shorten the injection time, the sample was injected with high flow rate to a trap column (Symmetry C18, nanoACQUITY UPLC 2D, V/M 0.180 mm × 20 mm, 5 µm, 100 Å, Waters) and a nano column (BEH130, C18 Acquity UPLC M-class peptide column, 0.075 mm × 250 mm, 1.7 µm,130 Å, Waters) was used for the analysis. Gradient elution was applied from 3 to 40% of eluent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) in 37 min. Mass spectrometry data were collected in a data-dependent manner, and a high-resolution survey scan was followed by a maximum of 5 dependent CID spectra analyzed in the ion-trap. Only multiple charged precursor ions were selected for fragmentation and after, they were excluded for 30 s from the repeated selection. PAVA script (UCSF, MSF, San Francisco, CA, USA) was used for peak picking and our in-cloud ProteinProspector (version: 5.22.0) server (https://cloud.mta.hu/) was used for database search, with the following parameters: UniProtKB.2017.9.19.random.concat database was filtered for the human, mouse, rat, and pig sequences (315,955/89,951,742 entries searched). Only tryptic peptides were considered, one missed cleavage and cleavage in front of Pro were permitted. Carbamidomethyl cysteine as fixed and several variable modifications were set as Acetyl (Protein N-term), Acetyl + Oxidation (Protein N-term M), Gln- > pyro-Glu (N-term Q), Met-loss (Protein N-term M), Met-loss + Acetyl (Protein N-term M) and Oxidation (M). Mass accuracy was set to 10 ppm for parent and 0.6 Da for fragment ions. Proteins and peptides were accepted with maximum 1% FDR. Identified proteins were accepted if a minimum of 4 unique peptides and 10% of sequence coverage were accurately identified. Significantly altered proteins were clustered based on the UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org) and GeneOntology (https://geneontology.org) databases as well as with the published literature. The most relevant functions of the proteins were taken into account for clustering. Databases of DisGeNET and Pathway Studio version 12.1 (Elsevier Life Science Solutions) were employed to discover the extent of overlap between significantly altered proteins in the CCH model and proteins that are known to have a role in the pathomechanism of AD. Modified Fisher’s exact test was utilized to determine the statistical significance of overlaps (EASE score < 0.05). Among the overlapping proteins, involvement in molecular pathways was screened to reveal, which cellular processes were affected. Interactions between overlapping proteins and the involvement of pathways of apoptosis, cell death, and memory were also examined with Pathway Studio 12.1.
Seventy-six patients with chronic HCV infection (47 women and 29 men, median age 58.5 years, range 25–88), who underwent anti-HCV therapy at the Warsaw Hospital for Infectious Diseases Outpatient Clinic in the years 2016–17 were studied prospectively. All were HCV- RNA positive for at least 6 months prior to therapy, and all were infected with HCV genotype 1 (genotype 1b was present in 74 and genotype 1a was present in two patients). Fifty-four patients were treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni, Gilead Sciences Inc, Foster City, CA, USA) 90 and 400 mg per day, respectively, and 22 patients received ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir (Viekirax, AbbVie Inc., Lake Bluff, IL, USA) at doses of 25, 150, and 100 mg per day, respectively, along with dasabuvir (Exviera, AbbVie Inc.) 500 mg per day. Treatment was administered for 12 weeks in 48 patients, whereas in 19 patients receiving Harvoni and in 9 patients receiving Viekirax and Exviera, the duration of therapy was 8 weeks. Clinical effectiveness of treatment was assessed 6 months post-treatment using a quantitative PCR test (Abbott RealTime HCV Viral Load Assay, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA; sensitivity 12 IU/mL). Sustained virologic response (SVR) was achieved in all 76 patients (100%). Eighteen healthy anti-HCV negative volunteers served as control group. Characteristics of the study and control groups are presented in Table 1. Thirty-six mL of EDTA-anti-coagulated whole blood was collected from all patients before and 6 months post-treatment while blood from control subjects was collected only once. The study protocol followed ethical guidelines of the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw (Approval Number KB/77/A/2015). All patients and controls provided written informed consent. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma were separated from whole blood using Lymphoprep reagent (Stemcell Technologies Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Plasma samples were stored at – 80 °C while PBMC were analyzed immediately after isolation. The presence of HLA-A*02 allele was verified by flow cytometry using Mouse Anti-Human HLA-A2 Clone BB7.2 antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and by quantitative PCR as described elsewhere. Isolated PBMC were resuspended in PBS pH 7.2 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), stained with BD Horizon Fixable Viability Stain 780 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and subsequently mixed with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) following manufacturer's protocol. Next, one million cells were resuspended in Stain Buffer with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BD Pharmingen). mixed with 5 µl of BV421 Mouse Anti-Human Tim-3 (CD366) Clone 7D3 (BD Horizon, San Diego, CA, USA), 5 µl of Alexa Fluor 647 Mouse Anti-Human PD-1 (CD279) Clone EH12.1, 5 µl of PerCP-Cy 5.5 Mouse Anti-Human CD3 Clone UCHT1, (both from BD Pharmingen), 5 µl of V500 Mouse Anti-Human CD4 Clone RPA-TY (BD Horizon) and 1 µl of Mouse Anti-Human CD8 FITC Clone LT8 (ProImmune Oxford, United Kingdom). Cells with added antibodies were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. After incubation, stained cells were washed twice with PBS pH 7.2 (Life Technologies) and resuspended in 300 μL of Stain Buffer. Controls included unstained cells and isotype controls consisting of cells stained with 5 µl of Mouse Anti-Human IGG1 Alexa Fluor 647 and 2.5 µl of Mouse Anti-Human IGG1 BV421 instead of Alexa Fluor 647 Mouse Anti-Human PD-1 (CD279) and BV421 Mouse Anti-Human Tim-3 (CD366), respectively (both from BD Pharmingen). For data acquisition, one million stained cells were used. The results were acquired immediately after staining by BD FACS Canto II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences), using BD FACS Diva version 6.0 program (BD Biosciences). HCV-specific CD8+ T-cell populations are difficult to detect directly. We employed a combination of MHC multimer staining, magnetic-bead enrichment, and multiparametric flow cytometry for ex vivo detection and characterization of rare antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. In 32 HLA-A*02+ patients (genotype 1b HCV infection), 25 million of PBMC were subjected to this procedure. In brief, custom PE-labeled Pro5 Recombinant MHC class I Pentamer containing HLA-A*02-restricted HCV NS31406 immunodominant epitope KLSGLGLNAV (corresponding to genotype 1b) (ProImmune) was added to cells resuspended in Stain Buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. The cell suspension was then washed with MACS Buffer (Miltenyi Biotec) and cell pellet was resuspended with Anti-PE Micro Beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and MACS Buffer and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C, protected from light. Next, cells were washed twice with MACS Buffer and passed through a 70 μm Cell Strainer (BD Biosciences). Magnetic MS Columns (Miltenyi Biotec) were used for cell separation following manufacturer’s instructions. Enriched cells were counted and stained with anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -PD-1, -Tim-3 antibodies for 20 min at 4 °C as described above. Without the enrichment, CD8+ specific T-cells were rarely detectable at measurable numbers in our patients (detectable in 14 (43.7%) of cases at mean frequency of 0.05% of total CD8+ T-cells before treatment and in 18 (56.2%) of cases at mean frequency of 0.07% of total CD8+ T-cells after treatment). However, using the enrichment procedure, detectability increased to 32 of cases (100%) and the average frequency increased 136-fold (to 6.8% of total CD8+ T-cells) before treatment and to 29 of cases (90.6%) and the average frequency increased 41.4-fold (to 2.9% of total CD8+ T-cells) after treatment. For data analysis, the initial gate was set on lymphocytes on the forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter (SSC) dot plot. Subsequently, singlet cells gate was set on FSC-H versus FSC-A dot plot. Next, based on SSC vs APC-Cy7 dot plot, only live cells were gated. Additionally, the following gates were employed: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, pentamer+, PD-1+, Tim-3+, PD-1+Tim-3+ and PD-1−Tim-3−. IL-10 levels were measured in plasma by ELISA (Human IL-10 ELISA Max Kit; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) following manufacturer's protocol. The ELISA Analysis program available from www.elisaanalysis.com was used to calculate IL-10 concentrations in plasma, expressed as pg/mL. Percentages of gated cell populations and IL-10 levels were expressed as median (range). Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test was used to compare percentages of T-cells expressing exhaustion markers and IL-10 levels before and after treatment while Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare patients with controls. Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare T-cell exhaustion markers and IL-10 levels between groups with different stage of fibrosis. A general linear model (GLM) was used to test independent pretreatment factors and treatment scheme on percentages of T-cells expressing exhaustion markers and IL-10 levels in plasma. All P values were two-tailed and considered significant when ≤ 0.05.
Yeast strains were grown in YEPD (20 g/L peptone, 10 g/L yeast extract, 2% glucose) when antibiotic/amino acid selection was not required, or synthetic complete medium (2 g/L amino acid dropout powder, 6.67 g/L yeast nitrogen base, 2% galactose) for plasmid maintenance. To induce Ty1 retromobility, precultures were grown at 30 °C and switched to 22 °C. Yeast transformations were conducted using standard lithium acetate-based protocols. Log phase cells were resuspended in LiOAC mix (100 mM lithium acetate pH 7.3, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) and incubated with transforming DNA, salmon sperm DNA (10 µg/µL) and PEG Mix (21 g PEG3350, 100 mM LiOAc, pH 7.3, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) at 30 °C for 45 min. DMSO was added and cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, cells were pelleted, resuspended in SOS mix (1 M sorbitol, 1/3 v/v YEP media, 6.5 mM CaCl2) and plated on antibiotic-containing YEPD or amino acid dropout plates. Deletions strains were validated by colony PCR and over-expressions were confirmed by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). All yeast strains used in this study are presented in Table S1. All primers are listed in Table S2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described. Yeast strains were saturated at 30 °C, and then diluted (1:4) and grown to log phase at 22 °C. Log phase cells were cross-linked for 30 min (1% formaldehyde, gentle shaking), washed (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, and 150 mM NaCl), resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, Sigma cOmplete protease inhibitor) and lysed with glass beads. Cell lysates were sonicated (20 s at 40% amplitude; three times with 2 min intervals on ice), cleared and split into input and IP samples. S9.6 antibody (2 μg; generated in-house) was added to IP samples, which were incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein-A sepharose beads were added and incubation was performed for another hour at 4 °C. The beads were then washed in lysis buffer, followed by lithium chloride buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) and TE (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA) to remove unbound DNA. Bound DNA was eluted from the beads (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS). Input and IP samples were incubated at 65 °C overnight for reverse crosslinking. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.2 μg/μL RNase A, and for 2 h with 0.03 μg/μL glycogen and 0.2 μg/μL proteinase K to remove RNA and protein. DNA was isolated and analyzed by qPCR (1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 30 s followed by 39 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 30 s and a final melt curve from 65 °C to 95 °C at 0.5 °C increments with 5 s/step). For qPCR analyses, IP signals were divided by input signals and normalized to CUP1 controls. Retromobility assays were performed as previously described. Yeast strains were grown in YEPD (or SC-Ura for strains over-expressing Rnh1) overnight to saturation at 30 °C and diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium. Diluted cultures were saturated at 22 °C (3–4 O/N). Various aliquots ranging from 100 µL to 1000 µL were plated onto SC-His (or SC-His-Ura for strains over-expressing Rnh1) plates, to determine the number of His + cells (those that have undergone a Ty1his3AI retromobility event). Serially diluted aliquots were plated onto SC (or SC-Ura for strains over-expressing Rnh1) control plates to quantify viable cells. Ty1 retromobility was calculated as the number of His + cells divided by the total number of viable cells plated on –His media. Where possible, two clones of each strain were assessed. DNA isolation was performed as previously described. Yeast strains were saturated at 30 °C, and then diluted and grown to saturation at 22 °C. Saturated cells were centrifuged and washed with sterile dH2O. Cells were resuspended in genomic lysis solution (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and glass beads were added followed by gentle bead-beating for 4–8 min at RT. The samples were centrifuged (16,000×g, 4 °C, 5 min) to separate organic and inorganic phases. DNA was precipitated with 3 M NaOAc, pH 5.2 and 100% EtOH, centrifuged (16,000×g, 4 °C, 15 min), washed with 70% EtOH and dried. DNA was resuspended in TE (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA) and treated with RNase A (10 mg/mL) at 37 °C for 10 min. Southern blots for Ty1 cDNA were performed as previously described with small modifications. Yeast strains were saturated at 30 °C, and then diluted and grown to log phase at 22 °C. DNA was isolated as described above. Southern blotting was carried out using the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit I (Sigma) following manufacturer’s recommended protocols. Briefly, DNA was digested with PvuII and fragments were electrophoretically separated on a 1% agarose gel (30 V 16 h). DNA fragments were depurinated (0.25 M HCl), denatured (1.5 M NaCl; 0.5 M NaOH), neutralized (1.5 M NaCl; 500 mM Tris pH 7.5) and subjected to capillary transfer (20X SSC) overnight. Membranes were crosslinked, probed and developed as outlined by the kit manual. Probes were generated against Ty1 using primers Ty1 cDNA-F and Ty1 cDNA-R to produce a ~ 1.5 kb fragment, following protocols outlined in the kit manual. Uncropped blot images are included in Fig. S5. RNA isolation and RT-qPCR were performed as previously described. Yeast strains were saturated at 30 °C, diluted (1:4) and grown to log phase at 22 °C. Cells pellets were resuspended in AE buffer (50 mM NaOAc, pH 5 and 10 mM EDTA in 0.1% DEPC) and 10% SDS and acidic phenol (pH 4.5) were added. Samples were heat-shocked at 65 °C for 4 min, then cold-shocked for 2 min. RNA was then phenol:choloroform extracted, washed with ethanol and resuspended in DEPC-treated H2O. RNA was quantified (NanoDrop) and stored at − 80 °C. RNA was DNase I-treated and reverse-transcribed. A 20 µL reaction was carried out with MMLV reverse-transcriptase (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocols. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 60 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. cDNA was diluted 1:4 and qPCR was performed as described above. Results were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method (normalized to ACT1). Protein was isolated as previously described. Yeast strains were grown to saturation at 30 °C overnight, diluted 1:4 and then grown to log phase at 22 °C. Cell pellets (2.5 × 107 cells) were washed and resuspended in H2O and incubated with Alkali/β-mercaptoethanol solution (1.85 M NaOH, 1.065 M β-mercaptoethanol) on ice for 10 min. TCA (50%) was then added and an additional 10 min incubation on ice was performed. Lysates were pelleted and resuspended in loading buffer (1X standard loading buffer, 1.42 M β-mercaptoethanol, 83.2 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.8), boiled and re-pelleted. Supernatants were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min prior to gel loading. Western blots were performed as previously described. Total protein was separated on an 8% acrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Ponceau staining ensured even transfer. Membranes were washed in 1X TBST and blocked with 5% milk, then washed with 1X TBST and incubated at 4 °C with primary antibodies (1:1000 for Actin and 1:5000 for Gag) overnight. Membranes were washed in 1X TBST, incubated with secondary antibodies (1:2000) for 1 h at RT, washed in 1X TBST, incubated with ECL substrate and digitally imaged using a ChemiDoc imager. Act1 is presented as a loading control. Uncropped blot images are included in Fig. S5. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described with slight modifications. The first immunoprecipitation for RNA–DNA hybrids was performed as described above with the following exceptions: two IPs were performed per strain and two 15 min washes with elution buffer were performed at the elution step. After elution, the IPs were collected into a single 15 mL falcon tube per strain. A 100 µL aliquot of S9.6 IP was saved as input. Eluted samples were diluted 1:20 in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, Sigma cOmplete protease inhibitor) and incubated with 2 µg anti-ssDNA (Millipore MAB3034) overnight at 4 °C. Protein-A sepharose beads were added and incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed in lysis buffer, followed by lithium chloride buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) and TE (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA) to remove unbound DNA. Bound DNA was eluted from the beads (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS). Input and IP samples were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse crosslink. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.2 μg/μL RNase A, and for 2 h with 0.03 μg/μL glycogen and 0.2 μg/μL proteinase K to remove RNA and protein. DNA was isolated and analyzed by qPCR (1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 30 s followed by 39 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 30 s and a final melt curve from 65 °C to 95 °C at 0.5 °C increments with 5 s/step). For qPCR analyses, ssDNA IP signals were divided by S9.6 input signals and normalized to CUP1 controls. For sequential ChIP data analysis, the first pulldown was conducted using the S9.6 antibody and the resulting pulldown samples were then used as input for a second pulldown with the ssDNA antibody. To assess how much ssDNA is present in every unit of S9.6 IP, we divided the signal from ssDNA pulldown over the signal obtained from the S9.6 pulldown. Additionally, the data were normalized to the ratios observed in wild-type cells, where low levels of Ty1-associated hybrids are known to exist as duplex structures related to the reverse transcription of Ty1 cDNA. A mutant with duplex Ty1 RNA-cDNA hybrid structures will resemble wild-type cells and have a ratio close to 1 (this is the case for rnh1Δ rad27Δ), while a mutant with triplex R-loop levels at Ty1 will have a value greater than the wild-type value of 1, since more ssDNA was pulled down per unit of S9.6 IP as compared to wild-type cells (this is the case for rnh1Δ rnh201Δ). Conversely, if the locus examined in wild-type cells were to contain mostly triplex R-loops (which is not the case for Ty1), a mutant with duplex RNA–DNA hybrids at that locus will have less ssDNA pulled down per unit of S9.6 IP as compared to wild-type (ratio < 1) while a mutant with triplex R-loop levels at that locus will resemble wild-type (ratio ~ 1). Overall, our data indicate that the Ty1 cDNA of wild-type cells and rnh1Δ
rad27Δ cells are associated with duplex RNA–DNA hybrids while Ty1 in rnh1Δ rnh201Δ cells is associated with triplex R-loop structures. We note that normalization can be performed relative to wild-type cells or mutant cells, as long as the second pulldown with ssDNA provides a value greater than zero, which could be obtained in a very clean pulldown from cells where the locus examined does not harbour any triplex structures. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 and included two-tailed t-tests, one-way ANOVAs or their non-parametric equivalents where appropriate. Following ANOVAs, post-hoc analyses were carried out. Statistics are represented in the figures by asterisks and the corresponding statistical test is described in the figure legend. Results were considered significant if p < 0.05.
Fresh tumors from PDAC patients (Additional file 1: Table S1) were collected at HonorHealth Research Institute (Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. Signed informed consent was obtained from each patient. Primary tissues from ten different patients with localized PDAC were obtained during surgical resections, and the biopsies of six patients with metastatic PDAC (5 liver metastases and 1 omentum metastasis) were obtained by 19 gauge needles. Freshly harvested tissues were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Cat #130-095-929, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) on a gentleMACS™ Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). After dissociation, single-cell suspensions were filtered using a 40-μm cell strainer to remove large pieces of debris. Red blood cells (RBC) were removed by incubating the cells with RBC lysis buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were then counted and evaluated for viability using the trypan blue (0.4%) staining assay. Single-cell whole transcriptome profiling of the dissociated tumor tissues was carried out using the Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression Solution system by 10x Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, US). Single cells were resuspended in PBS buffer at 106 cells/mL and loaded onto the Chromium chips. The single-cell capturing, barcoding, and cDNA library preparation were performed using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v2 by 10x Genomics by following protocols recommended by the manufacturer. The final sequencing libraries were checked for quality on Agilent 4200 Tapestation System and quantified by fluorometry staining (QuBit) assay. The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at a depth of ~ 50,000 reads per cell. CellRanger (10x Genomics) was used to generate digital expression matrixes from the FASTQ files obtained from the Illumina sequencing runs. In addition to the filtering of low-quality barcodes (cells), we also removed cells with small library size (< 1000 UMI) or few expressed genes (Shannon diversity index < 3, calculated using the diversity function in the Vegan package in R) were excluded from further analysis. The digital expression matrices for cells that passed the quality control were then input into the Seurat R package (v3.0) [11, 12] to generate Seurat objects for the comprehensive downstream analyses and visualization. The following Seurat functions were used in the Seurat pre-processing pipeline: NormalizeData, ScaleData were used to calculate the comparable expression values; FindVariableFeatures were used to include the variable genes that contribute to the overall similarity/variability of cellular transcriptomic profiles; RunPCA, FindNeighbors, FindClusters, RunTSNE, and RunUMAP were used to calculate the dimension-reduction coordinates for visualization and to perform unsupervised clustering. In the downstream analyses, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) coordinates to visualize the layout of the cells. AddModuleScore function in the Seurat package was used to calculate the gene expression modular scores for each cell. Cells in the same cluster have a similar level of modular scores, indicating similar gene expression profiles and presumably similar cellular function or state. Cells were mapped onto dimension-reduction plots based on their modular scores using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Signal distribution in each cluster was evaluated and visualized using Violin plots using the VlnPlot function in Seurat. To identify the cell types and subtypes that the tumors contain, two different methods were employed. The first method used the cell type markers that have been established in the literature [13, 14]. Those include EpCAM and KRT19 for ductal epithelial cells; COL1A1, ACTA2, and SPARC for fibroblasts; CDH2, SNAI2, and ZEB1 for EMT-like cells; CD3D, IL7R, and CD3G for lymphocytes; CD68 and G-CSF for monocytes/macrophages; KDR and VWF for endothelial cells; and FCER1A and CD1 for dendritic cells. The second was the supervised learning algorithm, SuperCT, which we described previously [15]. Briefly, a training set of 10x Genomics scRNA-seq data for ~ 200,000 cells representing 30 different cell types were used to train our SuperCT algorithm to establish the cell type prediction model. Once verified by additional datasets, the expression matrix files for the current study were input into the program. Each cell was assigned to one of the 30 different cell types (or unknown if does not match any of the 30 types) based on their expression profile. If the cells that were assigned to a particular cell type clustered together on the UMAP, then the cluster was identified as that cell type. This method allowed the identification of cell types that were not assigned using known cell markers. Inferred copy number variation (CNV) analysis was carried out using the InferCNV R Package [16]. The stromal cancer-associated fibroblast cells were used as reference cells and the hidden Markov model was chosen to predict the CNV states. The hypergeometric test that is implemented in the R package “clusterProfiler” [17] was used to perform the enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes or cell type-specific genes in Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The visualization function “dotplot” provided by clusterProfiler was used to generate the GO enrichment plots. Bulk RNA-seq datasets and the corresponding patient outcome (overall survival) data for PDAC patients were obtained from International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database (release 20 for US TCGA, Canada, and Australia cohorts) [18, 19]. To evaluate the correlation between the expression of cell type-specific signature genes and patient outcome, the top 20 signature genes (Additional file 2: Table S2) were first identified for each cell type (cluster) using the FindMarkers function in the Seurat package (FindMarkers ranks the genes based non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests between the cell type of interest and the rest of the cell types). An expression matrix was then generated for each of the 20 genes across the patients based on their expression levels. For a given patient, if the expression level of a given gene was equal to or greater than the median expression of the gene across all patients, then the matrix value for that gene in that patient was assigned as 1. If the expression level was less than the median expression value, then the matrix value was assigned as 0. For each patient, the matrix values for the 20 signature genes were then added up to obtain an overall expression score for the gene signature (and thus the cell type). The patients were then classified as high and low for the specific cell types, if their overall expression score fell into the top 25% quartile and the low 25% quartiles, respectively. The overall survival of the patients in those two high and low expression groups was finally compared using the Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank P value analysis. SuperCT is a cell type classifier we previously described [15]. It utilizes a machine-learning algorithm to establish a cell type classifier from the published single-cell RNA-seq datasets and then uses the classifier to predict the cell types in the new single-cell RNA-seq datasets that have a similar biological context. The cell-classifier is independent of the dimension-reduction and unsupervised clustering methods, which allows the identification of small cell populations that do not form distinct clusters. In this study, we used the v1i version of SuperCT to characterize the cell types for the total single-cell RNA-seq datasets [15]. To further characterize the T cell populations, we used the single-cell RNA-seq dataset of melanoma-associated T cells reported by Li and coworkers to train our SuperCT immune cell module and then used it to predict the T cell subtypes in the PDAC tumor tissues [20]. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8. The log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used to determine the P value (< 0.05 is considered to be significant), hazardous ratio (HR), and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cell line was procured from National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India. The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Himedia, Mumbai, India) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; BIOWEST, South America origin), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Himedia, Mumbai, India). Infectious EBV was produced by transfection of BAC-EBV-GFPWT into HEK-293 T (human embryonic kidney cell) cells, selection followed by chemical induction. We received the transfected HEK293T EBV BAC as gift from University of Pennsylvania, USA, which were further cultured in the lab. Cultured HEK 293 T EBV BAC were induced for 5 days with 20 ng/ml tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) and 3 mM butyric acid (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO). The supernatant from cell culture was collected and treated with DNAse. The viruses were concentrated by ultracentrifugation 23,500×g at 4 °C for 1 h 30 min and quantified through qRT-PCR [27–29]. The infective dose of EBV was determined by infecting 25 × 104 AGS cells seeded in 6 well plates with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 μl of the isolated virus. It was followed by isolation of mRNA, preparation of cDNA, and RT-qPCR for detection of EBNA-1. EBNA1 oncoprotein is the only viral protein expressed in all forms of latency during EBV infection [30]. We confirmed the presence of EBV in the AGS cells through RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR is a recognized method for determining multiplicity of infection which has been used in other studies as well, and thus we used this method to determine the titer value [31, 32]. We found that the infective dose resulting in high expression of EBNA-1 was 100 μl which corresponds to 20 MOI [33, 34]. The H. pylori strain I10 was kindly provided by Dr. Asish Kumar Mukhopadhyay (National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, ICMR, Kolkata, India). The reference strain I10 has also been used and reported in one of our previous studies [35]. The biopsy sample and gastric juice were provided by Dr. Ajay Kumar Jain (gastroenterologist), Choithram Hospital and Research Centre, Madhya Pradesh, India. Cell culture experiments were performed at 37 °C in a humidified environment supplemented with 5% CO2. The H. pylori strains were grown in Whitley DG250 Anaerobic Workstation at 37 °C with micro-aerophilic conditions (85% N2, 10% CO2, and 5% O2). The rapid urease test kit (CLO Test Ballard Medical Products, Draper, UT, USA) was used on gastric biopsy samples to check the presence of H. pylori. Gastric juices were also obtained from RUT positive patients. The tissue homogenate was prepared by crushing the biopsy samples. A loop-full of tissue homogenate was cultured on a non-selective medium such as Brain Heart Infusion media (BD-DIFCO, USA). This media was supplemented with H. pylori selective antibiotics such as vancomycin, cefsulodin, amphotericin, and trimethoprim with 10, 5, 5, and 5 mg/L, respectively (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). These plates were incubated in a micro-aerophilic environment for 3–5 days. A point sized colony was identified and used for the Gram staining. The colony was screened through morphological similarities with H. pylori. The samples were human gastric biopsy and gastric juice; thus, they were named HB and HJ, respectively, followed by a numeral that denotes the patient number according to the sequence of sample collection. Further, H. pylori were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 16S rRNA gene. For the present study, two clinically isolated bacterial strains were considered; HB1 (human biopsy sample#1), HJ9 (Human gastric juice sample#9), and one reference strain I10. The H. pylori bacteria were grown in selective media in a 14 ml round bottom snap cap tube (14 ml round bottom snap cap tube (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA - Catalogue No. 352001). They were then incubated in the microaerophilic chamber for 72 h. Subsequently, 150 μl of grown culture was placed in duplicate in 96 well flat-bottom plates, and optical density (OD) was recorded at 600 nm (Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader, BioTek). An optical density of 0.3 at 600 nm represents 500 million CFU/ mL [36]. The final OD value was normalized with media as a negative control [35, 37]. The number of bacterial cells per ml (CFU/mL) of culture was evaluated according to the final OD, and the required volume of the bacterial culture for infection was then calculated. 25 × 104 AGS cells were infected with H. pylori isolate I10, HB1, and HJ9 at MOI 100 and incubated at 37 °C for 6–8 h, subsequently further infected with EBV at an infective dose of 100 μL. The AGS cells were infected with EBV, EBV-I10, EBV-HB1, and EBV-HJ9, respectively. Uninfected AGS cells were used as control. The cells were trypsinized and diluted with trypan blue (1:1). The cells were counted through hemocytometer at 6, 12, 24, and 36 h, respectively, with white cells being viable and blue depicting non-viable cells [26]. The morphological changes in the cells were evaluated by DAPI staining. The confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was performed using Multi-photon laser (FV1200MPE, IX83 Model, Olympus). The ImageJ software was used for the cell length measurements. All the statistical data was analyzed by GraphPad Prism software. AGS cells (25 × 104) were seeded in 6 well plates followed by H. pylori infection through transwell inserts of 0.45 μm at MOI of 100. After 6–8 h, transwell were removed, and the cells were infected with EBV at an infective dose of 100 μl. This was followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 min followed by re-insertion of transwell insert. This setup was then incubated for various time intervals. For the direct infection approach, the rest of the protocol remained the same without the use of a transwell. The graphical representation of the experiments performed in the project is shown in Fig. 1, which depicts the procedure of direct and indirect coinfection in the cells, which were followed by other experiments like RT-qPCR. After 12, 24, and 36 h, cells were scrapped through cell lifter and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to get the pellet. This pellet was washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.4; 10 mM) twice and stored at − 20°c till further use.
 Schematic representation of the experimental setup performed in the report. Two approaches used for an experiment wherein Direct approach H. pylori was added to cells at MOI 100 without an insert. After 6–8 h, these cells were infected with EBV. Whereas in the Indirect approach, H. pylori-infected the cultured cells through an insert. Again after 6–8 h insert was removed, cells were infected with EBV, and again, the insert containing bacteria resumed in its original position The cells were infected with the bacteria followed by virus incubation for 12 and 24 h, respectively. The Trizol reagent was used for RNA extraction from co-infected cells. The isolated RNA (0.5 μg) was used to synthesize the cDNA with the help of the Takara cDNA synthesis kit. The primers for kinase genes are listed in (Table 1), subsequently primers for apoptotic genes and for H. pylori are mentioned in (Table 2). The thermocycler conditions used for the real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) were for 40 cycles and set at 94 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, respectively, using SYBR green. The expression analysis was carried out using 2-ΔΔt method.
 list of primers used with their primer sequences List of primers for apoptotic genes The analysis and quantification of the experimental setup were done through Image J and Graph Pad Prism software version 6, respectively. Biological triplicate was required for each experiment. Quantitative data were shown as mean ± SD. The difference comparison between groups was analyzed with independent t-test or ANOVA. In all analyses, p < 0.05 was seen as a significant level.
MDA-MB-231 (malignant) and MCF 10A (non-malignant) breast cell lines were purchased from ATCC and maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) and DMEM-F12, respectively. DMEM was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and DMEM-F12 was supplemented with 5% horse serum (HS). In experiments using SEVs, culture media were supplemented with SEV depleted serum (SEV−). To prepare FBS SEV− and HS EV−, the sera were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 x g overnight and the supernatant was collected. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% of CO2 atmosphere. Cell number was counted and cell viability was verified in a TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with 0.4% trypan blue (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) prior to experiments. pLenti-GFP-CD63 plasmid, previously described by Hoshino et al. [39], was used to make MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing GFP-CD63. Human MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) and 293 FT packaging cells were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS. 293 FT cells transfection, viral harvest, and transduction of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed as previously described [40]. Transduced cells were selected with 4 μg/ml of puromycin for 7 days. Recombinant DisBa-01 was isolated from inclusion bodies of E. coli BL21(DE3)-pET28a-DisBa-01 culture and purified to homogeneity as previously described [27]. Purified disintegrin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For EV isolation, 2.0 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in T-150 flasks containing 15 ml of culture media (total = 10 flasks) and cultured for 48 h until 80% of confluence. The culture media was replaced with 15 ml of Opti-MEM and cells were further cultured for 48 h to obtain conditioned media. Conditioned media was submitted to serial centrifugation to sediment live cells (300 x g for 10 min), dead cells (2000 x g for 25 min), and large EVs (10,000 x g, Ti40 rotor for 30 min), respectively. The supernatant was concentrated to 30 ml volume in a concentrator (Sartorius, VS6041Cat# and 100 k MWCO), layered over 2 ml of 60% iodixanol in an ultracentrifuge tube (25 × 89 mm for SW 32 Ti rotor), and further centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 4 h. We collected 3 ml from the bottom of the tube and layered it in a new centrifuge tube (40% iodixanol). Iodixanol solutions (20% wt/vol, 10% wt/vol, and 5% wt/vol) were layered over from the bottom to the top. Iodixanol solutions were prepared by diluting OptiPrep (60% wt/vol aqueous iodixanol; Axis-Shield PoC) with 0.25 M sucrose / 10 mMTris, pH 7.5. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 18 h using a SW45 Ti rotor and 12 fractions of 1 ml each were collected. Two ml of PBS was added to 1 ml fractions and ultracentrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at 100,000 x g for 3 h using a TLA 100.3 rotor. Vesicles were resuspended in 50 μl of PBS for subsequent studies. Purified LEVs and SEVs were quantitated by Particle Metrix ZetaView PMX 110 and the protein amount was measured using microBCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 23,235). We also uploaded all relevant data of our experiments to the EV-TRACK knowledgebase (EV-TRACK ID: EV190006) [41]. For negative staining of purified SEVs, 5 μl of EV samples was added to Formvar carbon film-coated grids (FCF-200-Cu; Electron Microscopy Sciences; Hatfield, PA) for 60 s. Grids were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in water for 20 min, stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 2 min, and allowed to air-dry. For each step, the excess of solution was removed by wicking with a filter paper. The grids were imaged using a TEM Tecnai F20 G2, 200Kv in 40,000 x magnification. Purified EVs were lysed with 1% SDS 50 mM Tris pH 7.6-lysis solution, mixed with SDS sample buffer, and loaded onto 8% acrylamide gels (10 μl). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Biorad) and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1–2 h. Membranes were probed with antibodies for EV markers, anti-CD63 (1:1000, Abcam, ab59479), anti-Flotillin (1:1000, BD, 610821), and anti-Alix (1:1000 Sigma, SAB 4200476). As a negative control, anti-Calnexin (1:1000, Cell Signaling, mAb 2679) was used. Appropriate secondary antibodies were added and detected by ECL (Thermo Scientific, 32,106 and 34,095). The same procedure was applied to detect integrins and ECM proteins such as fibronectin (Abcam, ab2413) and collagen (Abcam, ab34710). Ninety-six well plates were coated with collagen (10 μg /ml) or fibronectin (2 μg /ml) overnight at 4 °C. For the experiment, isolated SEVs were labeled with ExoGlow (System Bioscience Uniscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to incubation, vesicles were incubated with DisBa-01 in different concentrations (250, 500 and 1000 nM) in ice for 30 min and then plated (1.0 × 108 vesicles/well) over the coating for 4 h. After incubation, non-adherent SEVs were washed out and photomicrographs were acquired using a Nikon Plan Apo 60x/1.40 NA oil immersion lens in a Nikon Eclipse TE2000E microscope. For fluorescence intensity analysis, adhered green fluorescent vesicles were segmented from the background by thresholding and measured for integrated intensity using ImageJ Fiji (Analyze tab/Measure). Isolated small (EVs obtained from 100,000 x g ultracentrifugation for 18 h, Suppl. Figure 1) or large EVs were resuspended in PBS and added to a 96 well plate overnight (50 μg /ml). Prior to adhesion experiments, the wells were blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h. Fibronectin-coated wells (10 μg/ml) were used as a positive control of cell adhesion. DisBa-01 (100 nM) was incubated on EV coating for 30 min. After washing unbound DisBa-01 using PBS, calcein-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 106) were added and allowed to attach for 1 h. To measure adhesion, green fluorescence intensity was read in a SpectraMax I3 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. One day before the experiment, MCF 10A cells were plated in a 96 well plate in a density of 2.5 × 103 cells/well. Small EVs were labeled with ExoGlow kit (System Biosciences) and subsequently treated with DisBa-01 (100 or 1000 nM). After treatment with the integrin inhibitor, 1.4 × 107 vesicles/well were added over the MCF 10A cells and allowed to internalize for 4 h. After incubation, the supernatant was removed and cells were washed. The uptake of ExoGlow-labeled SEVs was analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy in the automated system ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices) using a Nikon S Plan Fluor ELWD 40X /0.60 NA magnification lens. MCF 10A cells (1 × 103) were plated on glass coverslips inside a 24-well plate. After MCF 10A cell adhesion, transwell inserts with pore size of 0.4 μm were added to the wells. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GFP-CD63 (1 × 104, treated and non- treated with DisBa-01 at 1000 nM for 30 min prior incubation) were added to the transwell inserts and incubated for 6 h. After incubation, MCF 10A cells were stained with DAPI and the cytoplasm marker Cell Tracker Red CMTPX according to the manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen, C34552). MCF10A cells were imaged in a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using a 63 X/1.3 NA objective lens. To measure the vesicles in MCF 10A cells, the green fluorescence was quantitated by integrated intensity analysis. Percentage of inhibition was calculated by comparing the integrated intensity of green fluorescence in MCF 10A cells incubated with DisBa-01-treated MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GFP-CD63 to that incubated with DisBa-01-non-treated MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GFP-CD63. MCF 10A cells (1.5 × 105) were cultured on glass coverslips for 48 h. After adhesion, cells were labeled with Cell Tracker Red CMTPX according to the manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen, C34552). MDA-MB-231 cells (1.0 × 106) labeled with Cell Trace CFSE (Life Technologies, C34554) according to the manufacturer instructions or stably expressing GFP-CD63 were treated with 100 nM or 1000 nM of DisBa-01 for 30 min (untreated cells were used as a control), plated over an MCF 10A monolayer and incubated for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI. Z-stack images were acquired in a Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan confocal microscope, using a 63x/1.40 Plan-APOCHROMAT oil lens and quantitated by integrated intensity using Fiji (Analyze tab/Measure). For extracellular SEV quantification, cell bodies were carefully selected and deleted from each image. GFP-CD63 deposits surrounding cells were segmented from the background by thresholding and measured for area and integrated intensity using Fiji (Analyze tab/Measure). For cell morphology measurements, each cell (ten cells per experiment) was manually selected and segmented from the background by thresholding and measured for area using Fiji (Analyze tab/Measure). MCF 10A cells (2.0 × 104) were plated in a Lab-TeK® chamber slide™ (LOBOV, Catalog Number: 177402) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. On the next day, MDA-MB-231 cells (DisBa-01-treated or non-treated) were plated at the same density over the MCF 10A cells and allowed to adhere for additional 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich®) for 1 h at 37 °C, and dehydrated by increasing ethanol concentration (50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100%, 10 min for each steps) before drying with hexamethyldisilazane (Sigma-Aldrich®). Cell morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (Inspect F50 - FEI®). Cell morphology quantitation was performed by measuring the area of cells, using Fiji (Analyze tab/Measure). DisBa-01 was labeled using Alexa Fluor® 546 dye (Invitrogen, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MDA-MB-231 expressing GFP-CD63 cells (1 × 104) were plated in 8-well Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ Chamber Slide (Thermo Scientific) and incubated overnight. On the next day, cells were incubated with DisBa-01 (1000 nM) for 1 h and 4 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with DAPI. Slides were mounted with mounting media Prolong™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Confocal images were acquired in a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using a 63 X/1.3 NA objective lens. Zen software was used to acquire images and laser power was the same for all conditions in order to compare the fluorescence intensity between different conditions. At least three independent experiments were performed to acquire data for quantitation. All data sets were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk normality test in GraphPad Prism software. Mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated and intergroup comparisons were made using One-way ANOVA or t Test (two-tailed paired or unpaired with Welch’s correction) analysis. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Raw fastq files of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data for five mouse tissues were gathered from ENCODE data portal (https://www.encodeproject.org/), including intestine, liver, lung, stomach, and kidney (Additional file 1) [39–42]. Two different development stages were considered in each tissue: embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and postnatal day 0 (P0) [39, 40]. The alignment bam files and narrowPeak bed files of H3K27ac for these five tissues with two development stages were also downloaded from ENCODE (Additional file 1). ATAC-seq data of five tissues with two development stages were separately processed by AIAP package that contained an optimized ATAC-seq data QC and analysis pipeline with default parameters [93]. Open chromatin regions (OCR) generated by AIAP were used in downstream analysis. Then, the two replicates of peaks of same tissue from two different stages were combined by using mergeBed [94]. RNA-seq data of five tissues with two development stages were processed by Cutadapt (v2.7; --quality-cutoff = 15,10 --minimum-length = 36), FastQC (v0.11.4), and STAR (v2.5.2b; --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM --outWigType bedGraph --outWigNorm RPM) to do the trimming, QC report, and mouse genome mapping (mm10) [95–97]. Then, the mouse gene expression was calculated by featureCounts (-p -T 4 -Q 10) [98] based on GENCODE vM20 gene annotation. The expression (TPM) of CHIT1 and HAVCR1 in those five human tissues were obtained from “GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_tpm.gct” file, which was processed and normalized by GTEx Portal (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) [99]. The H3K27ac alignment (bam file) and narrow peaks (bed file) of five mouse tissues at two developmental stages were downloaded from ENCODE data portal. The bamtobed of bedtools was used to process bam file and generate fragment file (bed files), which were further used to calculate the signal density (CPM) under each peak by using the intersectBed (-wa -c) command. The high confident H3K27ac narrow peak (with H3K27ac signal CPM > 3) were combined to the union peak set by using mergeBed, and used for downstream analysis. The transposable elements (TEs) data of mouse (mm10) were obtained from the UCSC database (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/database/) [100]. And the simple repeats, satellites, and TEs shorter than 100 bp were removed from this TE dataset. The GenometriCorr (Genometric Correlation) is an R package that is used to calculate the spatial correlation of genome-wide interval datasets with the null hypothesis: interval sets are spatially independent [7, 43]. The correlated interval sets would follow a detectable pattern of the location, such as being consistently nearby or far away from each other in genomic coordinates, or preferentially overlapping. The permutation tests with 100 times were performed to look for TE enrichment in the open chromatin regions. The accessible TEs in five mouse tissues were separately identified by two methods: (1) accessible TEs were firstly identified by the overlapping between TE and OCR peak with intersectBed (-f 0.5 -F 0.2), at least 50% overlap required as a fraction of TE element and at least 20% overlap required as a fraction of peak; (2) we calculated the Tn5 insertions of remaining TEs from method 1. Genome-wide Tn5 insertion counts were generated by AIAP, and Tn5 insertion of each remaining TEs and OCR peaks of five tissues at two development were calculated by using intersectBed, and further were normalized to the insertion per kilobase per million insertions (IPKM) based on total insertions of libraries and length of TEs and OCR peak. The 25% quantile IPKM of OCR peaks in each library was used as cutoff (Additional file 5: Fig. S9), and remaining TEs from method 1 with an IPKM over the cutoff were considered as accessible TEs. Finally, the accessible TEs identified by the above two methods were combined and used for analysis in the study. The coordinates of accessible TEs can be found in Additional file 2. The intersectBed [94] was used to determine the numbers of accessible TEs across genomic features (exons, first exons, introns, and intergenic regions), which were defined by using GENCODE vM20 gene annotation, in the five mouse tissues. Then, the enrichment ratio of accessible TEs in each genomic feature was calculated by dividing the number of accessible TEs in each genomic feature to the number of all TEs in each genomic feature (Additional file 4: Table S2; Additional file 5: Fig. S1). ATAC-seq data of mouse embryonic stem cell was obtained from GEO (accession number: GSE94249) and processed by the AIAP package to generate OCR peaks (ESC peaks) representing the chromatin open status in early development stage [101]. The accessible TEs identified in five mouse tissues that can overlap to ESC OCR peaks were defined as open in this early development stage (Additional file 4: Table S5). To measure the subfamily enrichment of accessible TEs in each tissue, log enrichment ratio (LER) was calculated by the observed number of accessible TEs in the subfamily over the expected number of all TEs in the subfamily across open chromatin regions by the following formula: 
The individual copy numbers in each TE subfamily were count by using TE annotation dataset described above. The enriched subfamily of accessible TEs was calculated and filtered with the following two criteria: (1) the number of individual TE copies in one subfamily should be greater than 10, and (2) the LER value should be greater than 3 (Additional file 4: Table S7). Accessible TEs that were only identified in one tissue was defined as tissue-specific accessible TEs. GO enrichment analysis of tissue-specific accessible TEs was performed by using GREAT (version 3.0.0) [102] with the following settings: (1) species assembly: mouse, NCBI build 38; (2) background regions: whole genome; (3) association rule: basal plus extension. Top 20 biological process terms were generated by GREAT with cutoffs of Binom FDR Q-Val < 0.05 and Hyper FDR Q-Val < 0.05 simultaneously (Additional file 6). GO enrichment analysis of accessible TEs constitutively identified in five tissues was also performed by using GREAT with the above settings. Mouse gene annotation (Gencode.vM20.annotation.gtf) was obtained from GENCODE to define the relationship between genes and accessible TEs [103]. The 500 bp upstream of full-length genes defined as the gene’s promoter region were used to overlap with accessible TEs by intersectBed. TE-derived TSS was defined by the intersection between accessible TEs and furthest 5′ end transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. The gene-type distribution of accessible TEs-derived TSS across five tissues was generated based on Gencode.vM20.annotation.gtf file of mouse genes (Additional file 7). CAGE-TSS data from FANTOM5 were used to validate accessible TEs-derived TSS across five tissues (Additional file 7) [73]. The examples of accessible TE-derived TSS and CAGE TSS locations were visualized on WashU Epigenome Browser [104]. For each tissue, we calculated reads count table of peaks at E14.5 and P0 by using AIAP package and used edgeR to identify differential accessible regions (DARs) in the comparison between two development stages (abs (log2(Foldchange)) > 1 and FDR < 0.05, Additional file 5: FigureS10) [105, 106]. Then, the accessible TEs overlapped with DARs were identified as differential accessible TEs between two stages in five tissues: (1) those accessible TEs with positive foldchange were defined as P0day-specific TEs that were more open at P0; and (2) accessible TEs with negative foldchange were defined as E14.5day-specific TEs that were more open at E14.5. The rest of the accessible TEs did not show the difference of accessibility between two stages (Additional file 8: Table S1). To explore the relation of differential accessible TEs on the gene expression at two stages, we assigned E14.5day-specific and P0day-specific TEs in five tissues to their nearest genes (the distance between TE and gene should be less than 20 kb), and the expression of those associated genes was tested by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the significance of the difference between two development stages. The enriched TFBS motifs of differential accessible TEs at E14.5 and P0 in five tissues were respectively discovered by using findMotifsGenome.pl (-size given) of HOMER software [107]. The enriched de novo motifs were selected with three conditions: (1) at least 10% of differential accessible TEs contained the motif; (2) match score of motifs should be greater than 0.9; (3) P value of the motif should be less than 1e−11. Then the known transcription factor genes (TF genes) with a motif match score > 0.9 to the enriched de novo motifs were extracted from HOMER results (Additional file 8). The evolutionary conservation of accessible TEs was measured by using phastCons conservation scores from mm10.60way.phastCons.bw file downloaded from UCSC, which contained conservation scores for alignments of 59 vertebrate genomes with mouse genome generated by phastCons program [100, 108]. The bigwig file was transferred to the bedGraph file with bigWigToBedGraph tool [109]. In total, 20,000 accessible TEs were randomly chosen and expanded 5 kb from the center at both sides, and their base-pair level phastCons scores were obtained by using intersectBed. Then, each 10-kb region was divided into 100-bp windows, and the averaged conservation scores of each 100-bp region were computed separately. Finally, the conservation scores at 100 bp resolution of all 20,000 accessible TEs were averaged and plotted. The evolutionary conservation of different genomic features, including exons, introns, and peaks without TEs, was separately analyzed by using the above method with 20,000 10-kb regions that were randomly chosen from each genomic feature. Open chromatin regions with TE or without TE in five mouse tissues were aligned to rat (rn6) and human (hg38) genome by using liftOver software with “-minMatch = 0.6” [64]. The mouse open chromatin regions that can successfully lift over to the rat or human genome were defined as orthologous in rat or human genome. Meanwhile, to measure the orthologous conservation at the genome-wide level, the whole mouse genome was first divided into 200-bp windows, and the orthologous regions were defined as the same standard as orthologous OCR described above, as well as those 200-bp windows that did not overlap with TEs. The orthologous conservation was also measured for the whole TEs in the mouse genome (Additional file 9: Table S1). Ortholog protein-coding genes with TE-derived TSS in three species (mouse, rat, and human) were first determined by using ortholog information obtained from Ensembl [110]. The mouse-specific and mouse-rat ortholog genes were further validated by using blastp, the protein sequence of mouse genes against rat (taxid: 10116) and human (taxid: 9606) reference database on NCBI, with the cutoff of both coverage and identify > 60% [111]. To assess the conservation of lincRNA, the cDNA sequence of lincRNAs were obtained from “Long non-coding RNA gene annotation” file of GENCODE (vM21 version), and then blastn method with “somewhat similar sequences” parameter was used to search each cDNA against rat (taxid: 10116) and human (taxid: 9606) reference RNA sequences [103, 112]. The orthologous lincRNA was defined as both the identity and coverage of the top blast hit to rat, or human reference RNA sequences can be over 60% (Additional file 9). Timd2 and Havcr1 genes of mouse were identified as duplicated genes in the Duplicated Genes Database (DGD) [113]. The sequence of cDNA and protein between Timd2 and Havcr1 was obtained from the Ensembl database (https://useast.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus), and the pair-wise alignment results were generated by Mview (Additional file 5: Fig. S3) [110, 114]. The gene cDNA sequences of Havcr1, Timd2, and Timd4 in mouse and rat were downloaded from the Ensembl database, multiple sequence alignment was performed by using muscle [115]. Then MEGA was used to construct the evolutionary tree of those genes with the neighbor-joining method [116]. The exon sequences of mouse Havcr1 and Timd2 genes were downloaded from the Ensembl database [117]. Exons of Havcr1 were aligned to the Timd2 sequence by using blastn with “somewhat similar sequences” parameter to identify the homologous exons between two genes [112]. The exon sequence coverage, identity, and gaps between homologous of Havcr1 and Timd2 were estimated based on the blastn results (Additional file 10). FIMO software was used to identify the TFBS motifs in the RLTR14-int elements based on motif weigh matrix file (JASPAR_CORE_2016_vertebrates.meme) from JASPAR [118, 119]. The ChIP-seq signals of Hnf4a, Rxra, Cebpb, and Pol2 genes were collected from GEO (GSM2406338, GSM1163178, GSM1854433, and GSM864688) and displayed on WashU Epigenome Browser [101, 104, 120]. The consensus sequence of RLTR14-int was downloaded from Repbase and was used to perform the pair-wise alignment with all RLTR14-int individual copies in the mouse genome by using muscle [115, 121]. The genomic information of proteins within the RLTR14-int consensus sequence was obtained from Dfam database [122]. FIMO software was applied to identify TFBS motifs for each RLTR14-int copy that can align to Timd2-TSS RLTR14-int element [119]. The base-pair conservation score of RLTR14-int alignments was calculated by the following formula:
 The mouse gene transcripts of five tissues at two development stages were assembled based on RNA-seq data. First, the sorted BAM files were generated after quality trimming by Cutadapt (v2.7) with parameter “-quality-cutoff = 15,10 --minimum-length = 36” and reads mapping to mouse genome (mm10) by STAR (version 2.5.2b) with the parameter “--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outSAMattributes NH HI NM MD AS XS --twopassMode Basic --outFilterType BySJout --limitBAMsortRAM 100000000000” [95, 97]. Then, StringTie (v2.0.4) with the parameter “-f 0.15 -a 20 -j 10 -m 200” was applied to assemble transcripts based on sorted BAM files [123]. Next, StringTie took as the input of a list of transcripts GTF files with coverage of at least 10 and merged these transcripts into a non-redundant set and compared assembled transepts to GENCODE gene annotation vM20. The quantification of the unified set of transcripts was calculated by RSEM (v1.3.0; -p 12 --bam) separately for five tissues at two stages [124]. In total, 316 TE-derived TSS genes were found to express in at least one tissue (mean expression FPKM > 0.1) and were classified into three groups based on the TSS usage of expressed transcripts: (1) only 5′ end TE-derived TSS used; (2) none of 5′ end TE-derived TSS used; and (3) both 5′ end TE-derived TSS and non-TE TSS used (Additional file 11: Table S1). Then, the expression percentage of TE-derived transcripts in each gene was calculated by the sum of the expression of TE-derived transcripts dividing the total gene expression. Based on the RNA-seq alignment (bam files) and gene GFF annotation file, the sashimi plots of each gene were generated by using sashimi_plot command in MISO framework to visualize the RNA-seq read densities along with exons and junctions, as well as visualize the structure of the gene’s isoforms [125, 126]. CAGE-seq peak-based expression table of robust CAGE-seq peaks for mouse samples with annotation was downloaded from FANTOM5 project [73]. The expression table of CAGE peaks at the embryo development stage of the intestine, liver, lung, stomach, and kidney tissues was downloaded from the FANTOM data portal (https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/data/) and further extracted by in-house script. The CAGE-seq peaks were assigned to either TE-derived TSS or non-TE TSS by using intersectBed with 1 bp overlap. Then the contribution of TE-derived TSS was calculated based on the expression level of CAGE-seq peak associated with TE-derived TSS in the total expression level of CAGE-seq peaks associated with both TE-derived TSS and non-TE TSS.
White Leghorn chicken eggs from Michigan State University were incubated in a humidified rotating incubator at 38°C. Retinectomies and FGF2 treatments were performed at embryonic day 4 (Stages 23–25 [6]) as previously described [10,11,47]. Embryos were collected at 6 and 24 h or 3 dPR and processed for histology, immunofluorescence staining, or laser capture microdissection. LCM, RNA extraction, and SPIA cDNA preparation were performed as previously described [11]. Briefly, intact embryos at St 23–25 or 6 and 24 h PR were collected, infiltrated with different concentrations of sucrose and embedded in 2:1 25% sucrose: OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA). Cryosections (12 µm) were collected on PEN Membrane Frame Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, LCM0521), followed by haematoxylin staining (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). LCM was performed using Veritas Laser Capture Microdissection system (Molecular Devices) to collect RNA using the settings previously described [11] or Arcturus XT (Life Technologies Carlsbad, CA) to collect DNA samples. DNA extraction was performed using PicoPure DNA Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), quantified using Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit high sensitivity (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or NanoDrop3300 and used in WGBS experiments. RT-qPCR was performed in a 20 µl reaction containing 5 μl (4 ng) of SPIA cDNA, 10 μl of 2x SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Qiagen, Maryland, USA) and primer mix to a final concentration of 500 nM. All reactions were performed in triplicate using iCycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and amplification conditions 10 min at 95°C, 35 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C, followed by 65°C to 95°C for melting curve analysis. Splice junction primers were designed using Primer 3 (v 4.0) [48] and were optimized following the guidelines described in [49]. Primer sequences and Ensembl or GenBank ID are described in Table S2. Comparative cycle at threshold (2−ΔΔCt) and unpaired Student’s t-test analysis were used to determine relative changes in transcript levels compared to gapdh mRNA levels as previously reported [50]. All analyses were performed in triplicate with at least three independent biological replicates. Primary antibody details and dilutions include rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, 07–449, 1:200), rabbit anti-H3K4me3 (Millipore, 07–473, 1:200), rabbit anti-H3K4me2 (Millipore, 07–030, 1:500), rabbit anti-H3K27Ac (Active Motif, 39,133, 1:500), mouse anti-5mC (33D3) (Abcam, ab10805, 1:100), rabbit anti-5hmC (Active Motif, 39,791, 1:200), rabbit anti-5caC (Active Motif, 61,225, 1:3000, including TSA amplification), rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam, ab6673, 1:100), rabbit anti-HRP antibody (PerkinElmer, NEF812001EA, 1:3000), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-546 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A-11,035, 1:100), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A32723, 1:100), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A32790, 1:100). Embryos were fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (Thermo Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) overnight (ON) at 4°C, transferred to 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 12 µm, and deparaffinized. Briefly, following antigen retrieval (0.01 M Sodium Citrate, pH = 6.0, 15 min), permeabilization (1% saponin, 5 min) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and blocking with 10% normal goat or donkey serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBST (0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS) during 30 min at 37°C, primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution as indicated in the antibodies section and incubated ON at 4°C. After washing in PBST (3 × 5 min), the samples were incubated 1 h in the dark at room temperature (RT) with the corresponding secondary antibody (typically 1:100 in blocking solution) and DAPI 30 nM in PBS (Invitrogen, USA Grand Island, NY) for nuclear counterstaining was included before cover-slipped using Fluoromount (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Controls to demonstrate the specificity of the antibody were included for every experiment, including samples with secondary antibody in the absence of primary. 5caC immunofluorescence staining was performed using a Tyramide Signal Amplification system (TSA plus Fluorescein, NEL741001KT, PerkinElmer), following the manufacturer’s instructions, including quenching of endogenous peroxidase for 20 min with 1% H2O2 and introduction of rabbit anti-HRP antibody ON at 4°C. All TSA amplifications were performed during 10 min at RT and negative controls not amplified or amplified (no primary antibody added) were included and used during confocal imaging. Confocal images (size 1024 × 1024) were collected on a Zeiss 710 Laser Scanning Confocal System (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) using a x20/0.80 NA WD = 0.55 or EC Plan-Neofluar 63×/0.75 Corr M27 objective lenses and a digital zoom of 7 to capture nuclei images. Imaging of each 488, 546, and DAPI were acquired sequentially in order to avoid bleed-through and pinhole size was consistently 1.0 airy unit (AU). High resolution images were obtained by collecting serial optical sections at increments of 0.3 µm apart in Z-stacks of about 15 images and processed with ZEN 2012 Browser (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Three-dimensional reconstruction (3D) of 2D confocal imaging was performed as previously described in [51]. Signal intensity analysis and quantification were performed using Image J Fiji plugin [52]. Briefly, each individual nucleus was selected using the freeform drawing tool in ZEN 2012 Browser and then processed. The positive immunofluorescence staining areas for each epigenetic mark and the associated mean fluorescence were measured by creating a binary image. The values are expressed as a percentage of epigenetic mark relative to DAPI from five different biological replicates in each experimental group. An unpaired Student’s t-test was applied for mean comparison using SigmaPlot 8.0 Software. In ovo electroporations were performed as previously described [11,53]. Briefly, using a Pico-injector system PLI-100 (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and glass capillary needles, embryos were injected 1 h PR with 3 μl of a mixture of pcDNA-Flag-Tet3 (3 µg) (Addgene Massachusetts, USA, plasmid 60,940 [54]) or pcDNA3-Flag-Tet3 catalytic (CD) mutant (Mut) (catalytic-dead mutations H950Y and D952A, Addgene Massachusetts, USA, Plasmid #72,222 [55]) and pIRES-GFP (1 µg), or 3 μl of a mixture at the same concentration of Flag-HA-pcDNA-3.1 (Addgene Massachusetts, USA, Plasmid #52,535) and pIRES-GFP as controls. Electroporated embryos were returned to the incubator and collected 72 h post-electroporation and processed for immunohistochemistry and histology. The following were the number of embryos electroporated with each combination of plasmids: n = 18 for pcDNA-Tet3+ pIRES-GFP; n = 9 for Flag-HA-pcDNA 3.1+ pIRES-GFP and n = 11 for pcDNA-Tet3 CD mut+pIRES-GFP. Embryos were fixed in Bouin’s fixative (Ricca Chem. Comp., Arlington, TX) overnight at room temperature, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 12 µm. H&E stained sections were photographed with an Olympus BX51-P microscope with Magnifier S99800 Camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and the images were processed and analysed using Image J [56] to quantify the NE generated from rRPE. Genomic DNA (gDNA) samples isolated via LCM were sent to the University of Michigan Epigenomics core for library preparation and sequencing. The gDNA samples were quantified using the Qubit broad range dsDNA kit, and quality was assessed with Agilent’s genomic DNA 2200 TapeStation kit. A total of 100 ng was used for each WGBS library preparation. Each sample was spiked-in with 0.5% (w/w) of unmethylated Lambda DNA prior to library preparation, according to the ENCODE consortium’s guidelines. DNA was fragmented to a range of 200–1000 bp on a Covaris S220 focused-ultrasonicator system. The samples were next processed for end-repair and A-tailing, before ligation of indexed methylated duplex adapters. The ligation products were cleaned with two rounds of AMPure XP beads before running on a 1% agarose gel for selection of fragments between 200-650 bp. After gel extraction, the ligated products were submitted to bisulphite treatment using Zymo’s EZ DNA Methylation kit, with the following protocol: 55 cycles of 95° C for 30 sec, 55° C for 15 minutes. Samples were kept at 4°C until cleanup. Final library amplification was done using the Roche FastStart Hi-fidelity DNA polymerase system. Sixteen cycles of amplification were used. The PCR products were then cleaned with AMPure XP beads, and the final libraries were quantitated using the Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA kit. Quality of the libraries was assessed on Agilent’s 2200 TapeStation, using the High Sensitivity D1000 kit. Libraries were sent to the University of Michigan Sequencing Core for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq4000 with paired-end 150 chemistry and sequenced to a depth of 50–70 million reads per sample. Raw reads were trimmed of low-quality bases (Phred quality score cut-off > 20) and adaptors using Trim Galore-v0.4.4 [57]. Trimmed reads were then aligned to the chicken genome, ensembl release 92, using Bismark v0.18.1 [57]. For analysis of differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs), methylkit-1.3.3 [58] was used with a read cut-off > 8x coverage and normalized, and DMCs were defined as cytosines with p-value < 0.05 and % methylation difference > 20%. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using BSmooth v1.20.0 with a read cut-off of ≥2x coverage [59]. Gene ontology analysis was performed using ClueGO, a Cytoscape plug-in [60,61], using genes with promoters overlapping with DMRs. Figures were generated using R.
The input to MONET is a set of L omic matrices. Matrix l has n samples and p features. The output is a set of modules, where each module is a subset of the samples. Modules are disjoint, and not all samples necessarily belong to a module. Samples not belonging to a module are called lonely. Each module M is characterized by its samples, denoted samples(M), and by a set of omics that it covers, denoted omics(M). Intuitively, samples(M) are similar to one another in omics(M). MONET works in two phases. It first constructs an edge-weighted graph per omic, such that nodes are samples and weights correspond to the similarity between samples in that omic. In the second phase, it detects modules by looking for heavy subgraphs common to multiple omic graphs. MONET constructs a graph G for each omic l separately. G is a full graph on n nodes. Denote by sim(u, v) some similarity measure between samples u and v in omic l. The weight assigned to edge (u, v) in omic l, denoted by w(u, v), is given by a function of the similarity between these two samples which we term "weighting scheme". This function is denoted f:
 The weight of a module is defined as:
 MONET's objective function is to find a disjoint set of modules M1,M2… maximizing Σweight(M). Importantly, we require that the weighting scheme returns values that are both positive and negative. High positive values indicate that the two samples are similar and should belong to the same module for omic l, while low negative values indicate the converse. A module with a positive weight therefore contains samples that are on average highly similar in the omics covered by the module. If all edge weights are positive, modules will always improve their scores by adding more samples and omics. Note that we present MONET here as a combinatorial optimization problem, but for some weighting schemes, the weight of each edge has a probabilistic interpretation. In such cases, the weight of a module is interpreted as the score for a log-likelihood ratio test for whether samples(M) form a module on omics(M), under the simplifying assumption that modules and sample pairs are independent. More details on this probabilistic formulation are in the appendix. To construct the omics graphs, any weighting scheme can be used. The scheme we used here is as follows. We first apply NEMO [7], a multi-omic clustering algorithm we recently developed, to each omic separately R times, each time on randomly selected 80% of the samples. We set  to 1 if samples u and v clustered together in the r'th run on omic l, and to 0 otherwise. Denote by  the average value of the  matrix, and by R(u, v) the set of NEMO executions in which both u and v were sampled. We set . The constant C controls the balance between modules that cover one omic (higher C value) and modules that cover multiple omics (lower C value). Here we used C = 0.2 and R = 100. For the classification experiments we used a different weighting scheme, which is based on a Gaussian mixture model. Its full details are in the appendix. Given all the omic graphs, MONET now detects modules with high weight by maximizing the objective function Σweight(M). There is no constraint on the number of modules, or an upper bound on module sizes, so the weighting scheme must create both positive and negative edges, otherwise the trivial optimal solution is a single module containing all patients and covering all omics. The problem of detecting heavy subgraphs in this setting is NP-hard even for the case of a single graph [19]. We therefore developed an iterative greedy heuristic for detecting heavy modules. The algorithm is initialized with a set of modules termed seeds. After seed finding, at every iteration MONET considers several possible actions, described below, that can increase the objective function. It then performs an action that provides the greatest improvement. ◼ Seed finding: Seeds are found iteratively. The first seed is determined by constructing a graph where edge weights are the sum of the edge weights in all individual omics, randomly selecting a first sample, and constructing a module containing all omics, which contains the first sample and its k neighbors with highest positive edge weights. All samples that were assigned to a module are removed from the graph, and the next seed module is sought. The procedure ends once S seeds were found. In this work we used S = 15 seeds for all datasets, and . ◼Optimization actions: Once a set of seeds is found, MONET improves the modules iteratively in a greedy manner. In each iteration, a module M′ is selected at random, and MONET calculates the gain in the objective function from a set of possible actions concerning the module. It then chooses the action with maximal gain. It stops when no action provides a gain in any module. The actions considered are (see ): The colors of the enclosing circle represent the omics covered by the module. Panel E shows the current state–two modules, where the left module (α) is covered by two omics and the right module (β) by one. An additional sample is lonely, i.e., does not belong to any module. Each other panel shows one action. B: the grey sample is added to module α. C: the grey sample is removed from module α. F: the grey sample moves into module β. I: module β is split. H: an omic is added to module β. G: an omic is removed from module α. D: modules α and β are merged. A: module α is discarded. In the shown case one of its samples is added to module β, and the other two become lonely. Actions for splitting module with omic or by adding omic are not shown. - Add a sample to M′. All lonely samples are considered. Since we observed that this action is commonly chosen in initial iterations when S and k are both small, we allowed up to 10 (or  if n>1000) samples to be added in a single action, to reduce the number of iterations. - Remove a sample from M′. - Move sample from module M′ to another module, or move a sample from another module to M′. All possible samples and modules are considered. Similarly to adding samples, we allow up to 10 (or  if n>1000) sample switches in a single action. - Add an additional omic to a module. All omics are considered. - Remove an omic from a module. All the covered omics of the module are considered. - Merge modules M′ and M″. The set of samples for the new module is samples(M′)∪samples(M″). The omics for the new module are one of the following: 1. omics(M′)∪omics(M″) 2. omics(M′)∩omics(M″) 3. omics(M′) 4. omics(M″). All four options are considered. - Split M′ into two modules. For this action, a graph is constructed with nodes samples(M′), and where the weight of the edge between u and v is Σw(u, v). In this graph we find a heavy subgraph M″, and create two modules, M″ and M\M″. The omics of both modules are omics(M′). - Discard M′. Each sample u in M′ is moved to the module M″ with the highest sum of weights from u to M″ using omics(M″). If all these sums are negative, u is made lonely. - Create a new module using all lonely samples. MONET finds a heavy subgraph in each omic separately, and a module is created from the heaviest subgraph found. - Split M′ by adding an omic. For every omic l∉omics(M′), MONET looks at the subgraph induced by samples(M′) on G, denoted G[samples(M′)], and detects in it a heavy subgraph. Denote the nodes of the heavy subgraph by U. We then split M′ into two modules. In one module the nodes are U, and the omics are omics(M′)∪{l}. In the second module the nodes are samples(M′)\U and the omics are omics(M′). - Split M′ with an omic. As in the previous action, a heavy subgraph with nodes U is found in G[samples(M′)], but here for every l∈omics(M′). Two modules are constructed. In one the nodes are samples(M′)\U and omics are omics(M′). In the other samples are U and the only omic is l that produced the heavy subgraph. MONET uses a parameter η for the minimum module size. Actions that reduce the number of samples below η are not executed, and module splits are considered under this restriction. Here we used . To find a heavy subgraph in a graph, we use a heuristic based on Charikar's 2-approximation to the problem of maximum density subgraph [20]. We iteratively find the node with lowest (weighted) degree and remove it from the graph, until no node is left. We then choose the heaviest of the sequence of subgraphs obtained during this process. The complexity of the heuristic on an n-node weighted full graph is O(n2). The MONET algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, because the sum of weights within all modules is increasing in each iteration. The algorithm stops when no action on any module improves the objective. In each iteration, all actions that do not involve finding heavy subgraphs consider each edge in each of the omic graphs a constant number of times. The complexity of all these actions is therefore O(Σ(n+|E|)), where E is the number of edges in G. The complexity of splitting a module and of creating a new module involves finding a heavy subgraph and is thus O(Σ(n+|E|)+n2). For the last two actions, for the same reason, the same complexity is needed for each omic considered for the split, and the overall complexity is O(L(Σ(n+|E|)+n2)), which is therefore the overall complexity of each iteration. For full graphs, this gives a worst case complexity of O(L2n2). The space complexity is O(Ln2). In a post-processing step we perform empirical significance testing to filter modules. Given a module, we sample 500 modules of the same size and omics, and only keep the module if its weight is in the highest 1%. In practice we only performed the testing for modules of minimal size (η = 10 here), as we never found larger non-significant modules. Samples that do not belong to any module after filtering are marked as lonely. Since the algorithm for finding heavy modules is only guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, the algorithm is repeated multiple times, and the best solution is returned. Unless otherwise specified, we used 15 repeats for the analyses performed in this work. ◼Partial datasets: MONET can handle datasets where only a subset of the omics were measured for some samples. Such samples are added to all omic graphs, but in omics where these samples were not measured their nodes have no edges. This way, omics in which no data were measured for a sample do not affect the decision of assigning the sample to a module. ◼Sample classification after clustering: Once modules were calculated from the data, MONET can naturally classify new samples into modules. For each module M, MONET calculates the gain in weight(M) from adding the new sample u to M: Σw(u, v), and classifies the sample to the module with maximal gain. If the gain is always negative, the sample is not classified to any module. This computation takes O(nL) given that the edge weights were already calculated. We applied MONET and several other algorithms to simulated, image and cancer datasets that are described later. Here we outline the way we evaluated the results. To assess a clustering solution where the true clustering of the data is known, we used the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [21]. Note that the ARI can compare solutions with different number of clusters and different cluster sizes. On cancer datasets from TCGA we performed survival analysis to assess the distinction in survival between the different groups of samples, and tested enrichment of known clinical parameters. For the survival analysis we used a permutation-based approach to perform the log-rank test, since the widely used asymptotical version of this test tends to overstate significance, and specifically for TCGA data [22–24]. We also used permutation testing to assess the enrichment of clinical parameters [5]. The clinical parameters we considered were gender, age at diagnosis, pathological stage and pathologic M, N and T. In addition we considered known subtype definitions—PAM50 for breast cancer [25] and the French-American-British classification (FAB) for AML [26]. For cancer datasets, we sampled 40% of the patients, partitioned them into three equal groups, and removed every group from one of the omics. For the image dataset we removed 20% of the samples in each omic independently. We then applied MONET to the data and calculated ARI with MONET's solution on all data. We repeated this experiment 10 times. to perform experiments on a dataset we first applied MONET to it. Denote MONET's solution by Sol. We then partitioned the samples in the dataset into 10 equal folds. For every fold i, we applied MONET to all samples except those in the fold, and denote the solution by Sol. We define the stability of the fold to be ARI(Sol,Sol) where the ARI is computed using only samples that appear in both Sol and Sol. We then classified the held out samples to the modules from Sol, and denote the solution after classification by . We define the Rand Index following classification (RFC) of the fold to be , where the ARI is now measured across all samples. For datasets where the ground truth is known we also measured ARI(ground_truth,Sol), and ), and term them the pre-classification accuracy (preCA) and post-classification accuracy (postCA) respectively. The simulations are described in the appendix. To check the clustering solution for enrichment of clinical parameters we used chi-squared test for discrete features (e.g. tumor stage) and Kruskal-Wallis for numeric ones (e.g. age). We also used chi-square to test for enrichment of mutations and used Benjamini-Hochberg to correct for multiple hypotheses. To find genes and miRNAs that are highly expressed in a module, we performed a one sided t-test (with α = 0.05) comparing the expression level in the module and the rest of the samples (after log normalization) and corrected for multiple hypotheses with Benjamini-Hochberg. Survival analysis was performed as described for the other TCGA datasets. To determine differential survival while controlling for the age and stage, we fitted a Cox multivariate proportional hazard model.
We obtained the informed consent from probands and their family members for genetic investigations in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. For the SCN5A gene, coding and adjacent intronic areas were sequenced using PCR-based bi-directional Sanger sequencing. The prevalence of the rare genetic variant c.206A>G(Y87C) was determined using allele-specific PCR in an ethnically matched group of 150 healthy volunteers, and in the public database gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). Pathogenicity assessment was performed in accordance with ACMG guidelines (2015) [18]. The potential effect of the variant was tested in silico using PolyPhen2.0 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), Provean (http://provean.jcvi.org/), and MutationTaster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/) tools. In the cDNA templates pcDNA3.1-SCN5A-WT, pcDNA3.1-S-tag-SCN5A-WT-NTD (a kind gift from Dr. Nathalie Neyroud, INSERM, Paris, France), and pcDNA3.1–3X-FLAG-SCN5A-WT, the following Nav1.5 variants were introduced (GenScript, NJ, USA): Y87C, R104W, R121W, and Δ26, in which amino acid residues 80–105 were deleted. S-tag-SCN5A-WT-NTD encodes the 131-amino-acid-long Nav1.5 NTD. The Cav1.2-WT-NTD and the homologous Cav1.2-R144W-NTD constructs were generated by replacing the SCN5A sequence in the pcDNA3.1-S-tag-SCN5A-WT-NTD cDNA with the Cav1.2 NTD sequence. Nav1.5-encoding cDNA corresponded to the transcript NM_000335.5 (human; Genbank) with the amino acid variant T559A, for which no functional consequences have been reported. Cav1.2-encoding cDNA corresponded to X15539.1 (cardiac isoform, rabbit; Genbank). Primers designed for mutagenesis are available upon request. All cDNAs were validated by sequencing. We obtained human embryonal kidney (TsA-201) and monkey kidney cells (COS) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, VA, USA). Cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s culture medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), which we supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were kept in culture up to 20 passages for experimental use. All transfections were performed with JET PEI (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For electrophysiological recordings, we cultured TsA-201 cells in 35 mm petri dishes. We transfected cells with 128 ng SCN5A cDNA to mimic a non-saturated homozygous state. To mimic the heterozygous state, cells were co-transfected with 64 ng pcDNA3.1-SCN5A-WT and 64 ng of a pcDNA3.1-SCN5A variant (Y87C, R104W, R121W, or Δ26) or empty vector (pCDNA3.1-Zeo(+)). All transfections additionally contained 64 ng pIRES-hβ1-CD8 cDNA, encoding the human sodium channel β1-subunit and the CD8 receptor. For biochemical experiments, we cultured TsA-201 cells in 100 mm petri dishes. To assay cell surface biotinylation, we transfected cells with 768 ng pcDNA3.1-SCN5A-WT or one of the selected variants, and 364 ng pIRES-hβ1-CD8. For calmodulin pull-down experiments, we transfected cells with 2 μg pcDNA3.1-S-tag-SCN5A-WT-NTD or one of the selected variants. For proximity ligation assays (PLAs), we cultured COS cells in µ-Slide 8-Well Grid-500 ibiTreat (ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany) and transfected them with 120 ng pcDNA3.1-S-tag-SCN5A-WT-NTD, one of the variants (Y87C, R104W, R121W, or Δ26), or empty vector. All institutional experimental guidelines for animal handling were met. The Veterinary Office of the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, approved our experiments. We isolated primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (RNCs) and cultured them at 37°C with 1% CO2[19]. RNCs were seeded on laminin-coated (Sigma, MO, USA) µ-Slide 8-Well Grid-500 ibiTreat dishes (ibidi). Cells were transfected 24 h after cell seeding using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA). To study the subcellular localization of Nav1.5 full-length channels in the homozygous state, we transfected RNCs with 400 ng pcDNA3.1–3X-FLAG-SCN5A-WT or one of the variants Y87C, R104W, or R121W. To study their subcellular localization in the heterozygous state, we transfected RNCs with 200 ng pcDNA3.1-GFP-SCN5A-WT and 200 ng of one of the variants. All conditions additionally contained 100 ng pDsRed2-ER (Takara Clontech, Kusatsu, Japan) as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker. To computationally predict CaM binding to Nav1.5 NTD, we used the CaM target database (http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/ctdb/sequence.html). Scores are normalized on a scale from 0 to 9, 0 being low and 9 being high probability of CaM binding. Peptides were synthesized using standard 9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl (Fmoc) protected and activated amino acids (Anaspec, CA, USA) on prederivatized cellulose membranes (Intavis AG, Cologne, Germany) using an Intavis robot [20]. Human Nav1.5 (Q14524 (SCN5A_Human) isoform 1) N-terminal domain 1–131 was tiled as 15 amino acid peptides with a 13-amino acid overlap (two amino acids skipped between consecutive peptides). The membrane was briefly wet with dimethylformamide (DMF) and peptides were labeled with bromophenol blue (1%) for annotation of the array pattern at the completion of synthesis as described previously [20,21]. The peptides on the array were then de-protected with two washes of 88% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% triisopropylsilane, 5% phenol, and 5% water, for 90 min each at room temperature. Each de-protection step was followed by three washes with dichloromethane, three washes with DMF, and three washes with ethanol and the membranes dried. Before binding experiments, the membrane was wet by exposure to ethanol for 15 min, followed by DMF for 15 min and three 15 min washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), all while shaking at room temperature. The hydrated membrane was then equilibrated for 30 min in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20, before the membrane was blocked in the same buffer plus 5% bovine serum album (BSA) for 30 min. The binding buffer used in the CaM binding reaction was identical to membrane equilibration buffer, except 5 mM EGTA was included in the buffer along with 100 nM of DyLight680-labeled CaM; mutant Cys-75 CaM purified as described previously [22,23] and labeled with a sulfhydryl reactive maleimide fluorophore as described by the manufacturer (Fisher #46618). After 5 min at room temperature, the apoCaM binding reaction was washed in binding buffer (3 × 15 min including plus 5 mM EGTA) before the membrane was imaged using a Li-Cor Imaging Station (Li-Cor Biosciences, Bad Homberg, Germany). We used a cell surface biotinylation assay to study protein expression at the plasma membrane. 48 h after transfection, TsA-201 cells transiently expressing Nav1.5 constructs were supplied with 0.5 mg/mL EZ-link™ Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 15 min at 4°C. Then, we washed the cells twice with 200 mM glycine in cold PBS to inactivate and remove excess biotin, respectively. Cells were taken up in lysis buffer (composed of [mM] HEPES 50 pH 7.4, NaCl 150, MgCl2 1.5, EGTA 1 pH 8; 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 (Tx100), complete protease inhibitor [Roche, Basel, Switzerland]) for 1 h at 4°C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,100 rcf at 4°C for 15 min. We determined protein concentration of the supernatant with Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) [24], and incubated lysate equivalent to 2 mg of protein with 50 μL Streptavidin Sepharose High-Performance beads (GE Healthcare, IL, USA) for 2 h at 4°C, then washed the beads three times with lysis buffer, and eluted them with 30 μL of 2X NuPAGE sample buffer plus 100 mM DTT (37°C for 30 min). Input fractions were resuspended in NuPAGE Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) plus 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. We used the calmodulin pull-down assay to determine whether Nav1.5 and Cav1.2 constructs bind calmodulin. 48 h after transfection, TsA-201 cells were lysed in lysis buffer with 100 nM free Ca2+ for 1 h at 4°C. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated based on an established method [25]. Lysed samples were centrifuged at 16,100 rcf at 4°C for 15 min. We quantified supernatant protein concentration with the Bradford assay. After washing calmodulin and control Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) twice with lysis buffer, we mixed lysate corresponding to 60, 180, or 540 μg protein with the beads. Beads and lysate mixture incubated at 4°C on a wheel for 3 hours. We washed the beads three times with lysis buffer and eluted proteins from the beads in 30 µL 2X NuPAGE sample buffer with 100 mM DTT at 55°C (15 min). Protein samples were loaded on pre-casted 4–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen), run at 60 V for 30 min and at 200 V for 45–120 min, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) with the TurboBlot dry blot system (Bio-Rad). Western blots were performed with the SNAP i.d. system (Millipore, Zug, Switzerland). Briefly, membranes were blocked with 1% BSA, incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS + 0.1% Tween20 for 10 minutes, washed four times with PBS + 0.1% Tween20, incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS + 0.1% Tween20, washed again four times with PBS + 0.1% Tween20 and three times with PBS. Fluorescent signals were detected on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). We determined protein content by quantifying band fluorescence densities with the Image Studio Lite software version 5.2 (Li-Cor). The following primary antibodies detected the proteins of interest: mouse anti-α-CaMKII (1:3000; BD, NJ, USA; 611292); rabbit anti-α-actin (1:3000, Sigma, A2066); mouse anti-S-tag (1:1500, Sigma, SAB2702204); rabbit anti-Nav1.5 (1:150, generated by Pineda, Berlin, Germany); and mouse anti-alpha-1 sodium-potassium ATPase (1:3000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab7671). Secondary IRDye® antibodies (Li-Cor) were 680RD goat anti-mouse (1:15000; 926–68070), 800CW goat anti-mouse (1:15000; 926–32210), and 800CW goat anti-rabbit (1:15000, 925–32211). We isolated total RNA from TsA-201 cells transiently expressing pcDNA3.1-hSCN5A-WT, Y87 C, R104 W, R121 W, or Δ26 with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We used 2 µg RNA for reverse transcription with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The cDNA was diluted (1:10) in H2O for qPCR with the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems). qPCR conditions in the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were as follows: activation 2 min at 50°C; hold 20 s at 95°C; 40 cycles of denaturation 3 s at 95°C and annealing 60 s at 60°C. We normalized the expression levels of human SCN5A (HS00165693_m1) to the reference gene GAPDH (HS99999905_m1), and then to the SCN5A WT expression using the 2−ΔΔCt method [26]. Whole-cell currents were recorded 48 hours after transfection using the patch-clamp technique with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, United Kingdom) at room temperature (25 ± 1°C)[27]. The recorded INa was filtered at 5 kHz by a low-pass filter (HumBug, Quest Scientific, BC, Canada) at a sampling rate of 20 kHz per signal. Leak current subtraction was applied with a P/4 protocol. We used the DMZ-universal puller (program 10, Zeitz, Martinsried, Germany) to pull the patch pipettes (World Precision Instruments, Friedberg, Germany) to a resistance of 2.0 to 4.5 MΩ. The internal pipette solution contained (mM) CsCl 60, aspartic acid 50, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, EGTA 11, Na2ATP 5. pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The external solution contained (mM) NaCl 25, NMDG-Cl 105, CsCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1.2, HEPES 10, glucose 20. pH was adjusted to 7.4 with HCl. We used the voltage clamp mode to obtain current–voltage relationships (I–V curves). Sodium current density (pA/pF) was calculated by dividing peak current by cell capacitance using the Axon™ pCLAMP™ 10 Electrophysiology Data Acquisition & Analysis Software, Version 10.7.0.3 (Axon Instruments, CA, USA). I–V curves were fitted with the equation y = g(Vm – Vrev)/((1 + exp[(Vm –
V1/2)/K])). Activation and steady-state inactivation (SSI) curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation y = 1/(1 + exp[(Vm – V1/2)/K]), where y is the normalized current or conductance at a given holding potential, Vm is the membrane potential, Vrev is the reversal potential, V1/2 is the potential at which half of the channels are activated, and K is the slope factor. To investigate Nav1.5 subcellular localization, we performed immunocytochemistry on transiently transfected RNCs. Two days after transfection, RNCs were fixed with cold acetone at −20°C (10 min), washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.5% Tx100 and 10% normal goat serum in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in incubation buffer (1% BSA, 0.5% Tx100 and 3% goat serum in PBS) were applied overnight at 4°C. We used the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) to detect FLAG-Nav1.5 and rabbit anti-GFP (Thermo Fisher, G10362) to detect GFP-Nav1.5. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit 405 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)) diluted 1:200 in incubation buffer. We stained the nuclei with DAPI or NucRed dead 647 ReadyProbes Reagent (2 drops/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mounting medium (EMS shield with Dabco; EMS, PA, USA) was added to preserve fluorescence signals. To determine whether two proteins were close in situ, we performed PLAs using the Duolink® Starter Kit Mouse/Rabbit (Sigma) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We transiently transfected COS cells with pcDNA3.1-S-tag-SCN5A-WT, -WT NTD and Δ26 NTD. Forty-eight hours after transfection, we fixed them with acetone at −20°C for 10 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS before they were permeabilized with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.5% Tx100 and 10% goat serum in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in incubation buffer (1% BSA, 0.5% Tx100, and 3% goat serum in PBS) overnight at 4°C. We used the following primary antibodies: rabbit-anti-S-tag (for S-tagged NTD, 1:100, Abcam, ab180958) and mouse anti-calmodulin (1:100, Merck, 05–173); or mouse anti-S-tag (for S-tagged NTD, 1:1500, Sigma, SAB2702204) and rabbit anti-Nav1.5 (1:150, generated by Pineda, Berlin). After washing the cells 3X with PBS, we incubated them with anti-rabbit PLUS and anti-mouse MINUS PLA probes (1 hour at 37°C) diluted in Duolink® incubation buffer (1:200; Sigma), followed by three washes with PBS. We followed the manufacturer’s instructions for probe ligation and signal amplification. Duolink® in situ mounting medium with DAPI was added to stain cell nuclei and preserve fluorescence signals. Confocal images were obtained with an inverted laser-scanning microscope (LSM 880, ZEN 2.1, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.40 Oil DIC objective. We collected COS cell images in the confocal mode and analyzed them with the Duolink® ImageTool (Sigma) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNC images were collected in the Airyscan super-resolution mode with the pinhole set at 1.25 Airy unit, pixel size was 35 × 35 nm. We used ZEN 2.1 software for processing raw Airyscan data, and the IMARIS coloc tool (IMARIS 9.3.1 software, Bitplane, Zürich, Switzerland) to quantify the colocalization between signals of two channels within the predefined ROI (region of interest, defined as the cell area). We set an automatic threshold per channel. If the automatic threshold could not be defined, we set the threshold at 30%. Data are represented as means ± SEM and are compared to the wild-type condition unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was calculated with two-tailed Student’s t-test if data were normally distributed, by the Mann–Whitney U-test if data were not, and by one-way ANOVA resp. Kruskal–Wallis when comparing more than two groups (Prism version 7.04; GraphPad, CA, USA). We considered a p-value <0.05 to indicate a statistically significant difference.
This study was conducted using the “Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis” guidelines. The study methodology was registered with the PROSPERO database (Reference: 159776). The electronic PubMed (NCBI, Bethesda, MD), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ), and EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) databases were systematically searched for all studies relating to lncRNA and their role in EMT in colorectal adenocarcinoma. No restrictions were placed upon the language. The search was restricted from January 1st 1990 to June 31st 2019. The following search terms were used: “colorectal cancer,” “colorectal adenocarcinoma,” “colon cancer,” “rectal cancer,” “colon adenocarcinoma,” “rectal adenocarcinoma,” “lncRNA,” “long non-coding RNA,” “Epithelial-mesenchymal transition,” and “EMT.” The Boolean search terms “AND” and “OR” were used to define the search. Searches from all databases were collated and duplicate references removed. Studies were included if they investigated the molecular signaling role of lncRNAs in EMT in colorectal cancer and/or investigated tumoral expression of lncRNAs in human clinical samples along with including related survival outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer. Studies were excluded if they did not specifically pertain to colorectal cancer, were focused on microRNA signaling, or were review papers. Two reviewers (SO’B and CB) extracted data from the selected studies. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance by these two reviewers, and in the case of uncertain relevance to the review, the senior author reviewed the paper. Other significant articles from the references of the identified papers were included. The following data were extracted from each of the selected studies: authors, year of publication, journal of publication, main study hypothesis, use of human tumor tissue, colorectal cancer cell line selection and use, experimental techniques used, main study findings, and study limitations.
Although obesity and prediabetes are known to be associated [7,8], there is no previous MR evidence about the causal direction between them in non-diabetic individuals. To this end, we performed an MR analysis to investigate whether prediabetes (assessed by serum HbA1C level between 5.7–6.4 [38]) is caused by obesity. Fig 1A shows the two-sample MR models we used to explore causal associations between prediabetes and obesity (body fat percent). As BMI reflects both fat and lean mass, we used body fat percent instead of BMI in our MR analyses to utilize a more specific surrogate of obesity [39,40]. For this MR analysis, we first randomly separated the UKB cohort into two independent groups (n = ~190k in each group). Then we performed a GWAS for body fat percent in one of the UKB groups that identified 74 non-redundant SNPs (R2<0.01) significantly associated with body fat percent (p<5×10−8), which we used as the genetic instrumental variables (IVs) in the MR analysis (see Methods). Next, we used the second UKB group to perform a GWAS analysis on prediabetes to fulfill the two-sample MR design. Since dyslipidemia and abnormal blood pressure are known factors associated with obesity and diabetes [41,42], we excluded the IVs that are significantly associated with diastolic/systolic blood pressure or serum total triglycerides in the UKB cohort to avoid potential pleiotropy. Finally, we used the summary statistics from the GWAS analysis and MR-PRESSO [43] to identify a significant positive causal effect of body fat percent on prediabetes in the UKB (estimate effect = 0.039; adjusted p-value = 1.2×10−3). To further investigate the effect of obesity on prediabetes, we also employed MR-egger and heterogeneity test on the IVs adjusted by MR-PRESSO. Although MR-egger did not identify a significant causal effect of body fat percent on prediabetes using the threshold of p-value < 0.05, neither MR-egger nor heterogeneity test identified a significant pleiotropy in this MR analyses (Fig 1C). Since MR-egger usually tend to have less power compared to other MR methods [44], finding no evidence for pleiotropy from MR-egger and heterogeneity test appears still to be in line with the causal effect of body fat percent on prediabetes identified by MR-PRESSO (Fig 1C). This also suggests that our MR model fulfills the second and third assumptions of MR analysis (i.e. the IV is not associated with the hidden confounders or with the outcome variable (i.e. prediabetes) when conditioning on the exposure variable (i.e. body fat percent)). To test the possibility of the reverse causal path, we utilized 47 independent prediabetes GWAS SNPs as IVs from our GWAS in the second half of the UKB and explored the potential causal effect of prediabetes on obesity. Fig 1D shows that there is no causal effect of prediabetes on body fat percent (estimated effect = 0.13, adjusted p-value > 0.05). As we performed 3 MR analyses to explore the causal effects among obesity, insulin resistance and prediabetes, we adjusted the p-values of causal effects for 3 tests using a Bonferroni correction. Thus, using MR in the UKB, we established a one-way causal effect of obesity on prediabetes.
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of Tokyo Medical and Dental University (ethical approval number: M2020-089). Written informed consents were obtained from patients or guardians upon admission. Our tertiary university hospital is located in the center of Tokyo metropolis area where the population is approximately 3.5 million and serviced by 5 tertiary emergency medical centers. The Tokyo metropolitan government designated two hospitals including ours out of five as COVID-19 specialized treatment facilities. As a result, between March 10th and June 2nd, 2020, a total of 45 admitted patients tested positive through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 and had evidence of pneumonia on computed tomography (CT). Tables 1 and 2 summarize the patient background and initial laboratory findings. Values are presented as median (IQR: interquartile range). Group S consists of severe cases requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Group M consists of moderate cases not requiring mechanical ventilation support managed on the general wards. Cardiovascular diseases include congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. Respiratory diseases include bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, pleuritis, and pneumonia. Malignancy includes colonic cancer, spinal tumor, brain tumor, prostate cancer, oral cancer, and malignant lymphoma. CKD: Chronic kidney disease; GERD: gastroesophageal reflux disease; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; NS: not significant. Values are presented as median (IQR: interquartile range). PT-INR: prothrombin time-international normalized ratio; APTT: activated partial thromboplastin time; FDP: fibrin degradation products; BUN: blood urea nitrogen; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: alanine aminotransferase; CK: creatine kinase; CRP: C-reactive protein; NS: not significant. All patients in this study showed positive results for PCR diagnostic tests of nasopharyngeal samples using the method developed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. The diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed by respiratory medicine specialists based on CT findings. All medications used in this study are readily available for clinical use in Japan. However, the level of efficacy of these medications on COVID-19 has not been determined [11]. Thus, treatment regimen was not consistent through the study period (Table 3). ECMO: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; CHDF: Continuous hemodiafiltration; CRRT: Continuous renal replacement therapy; ICU: intensive care unit; USD: United States dollar; AT: antithrombin III; CS: ciclesonide; FV: favipiravir; HC: hydrocortisone; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; Hep: intravenous heparin sodium; HepCa: subcutaneous heparin calcium; INH: isoniazid; IVIG: intravenous immunoglobulin; mPSL: methylprednisolone; NM: nafamostat mesylate; rTM: human recombinant thrombomodulin; TZB: tocilizumab; XR: rivaroxaban; N/A: not available. Favipiravir [12], an anti-influenza reagent, was given to all patients orally or via nasogastric tube. The loading dose was 3.6 gm/day, with a maintenance dose was 0.8 gm/day for up to 14 days. Ciclesonide [13], an inhaler bronchodilator, was given to mild to moderate patients. Hydroxychloroquine [14] was given to the severe patients and its loading dose was 800 mg/day followed by a maintenance dose, 400 mg/day for 4 days. Tocilizumab [15], an anti-interleukin 6 receptor monoclonal antibody, was used for severe patients at a one-time dose of 8 mg/kg. Methylprednisolone, used in interstitial pneumonia, was used for severe patients at a dose of 500–1,000 mg for 3 days, and then tapered. The decision or recommendation for each individual drug use was given by the respiratory medicine team depending on the severity of the pneumonia and the CT findings. Tracheal intubation criteria were (1) low oxygen concentration (90<SpO2), (2) hemodynamically unstable, and (3) tachypnea with respiratory efforts. Patients were placed on mechanical ventilators (Evita® V300, Dräger, Lübeck, Germany) after endotracheal intubation. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set to not too excessive (<20 cmH2O) to avoid barotrauma. Patients were placed on prone position, if necessary [16]. The extubation criteria were (1) awake and oriented, (2) capable of expectoration, (3)hemodynamically stable, (4) showing normal blood gas, (5) respiratory rate ≤35 per minute, (6) tidal volume >5 ml/kg, (7) FiO2 ≤0.4, PEEP ≤8cmH2O, SpO2 >90% or P/F >150, and (8) RSBI (RR/VT) <100/min/L. VV-ECMO (SP-200 NEO, Terumo Corp., Tokyo) was used in severe cases of respiratory distress where the patient could not maintain their respiratory function even while fully supported by mechanical ventilation. The indication criteria in COVID-19 cases were as follows; (1) PaO2/FaO2 ratio (P/F) <80 mmHg for >6 hours, (2) P/F <50 mmHg for >3 hours, (3) pH <7.25 with PaCO2 ≥60 mmHg for >6 hours after making every effort to try prone position, muscle relaxant, high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy, nitric oxide inhalation, and recruitment maneuver, and (4) P/F ≥150 mmHg and pH <7.25 with PaCO2 ≥60 mmHg for 6 hours. The exclusion criteria were (1) not consented, (2) hemorrhagic complications, (3) severe disturbance of central nervous system, (4) end-of-life stage, and (5) ≥75-year-old. Our withdrawal criteria were similar to the interim Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guideline [17]. COVID-19 has been reported to cause a hypercoagulation state which sometimes manifests clinically as microvasculitis and biochemically high FDP or D-dimer [18]. Therefore, anticoagulants were given unless otherwise contraindicated. Intravenous heparin as well as nafamostat mesylate, recombinant human thrombomodulin, and antithrombin III were given referring to activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and activated clotting time (ACT). When the patients were on VV-ECMO and/or CRRT, anticoagulation including heparin was mandatory. The criteria for placing a patient in the prone position are the following. The prone position is considered when (1) the patient’s P/F ratio goes down to below 200; (2) the CT shows severe inflammation and/or consolidation mainly on the dorsal side of the lung. The prone position is considered contraindicated when (1) the patient is unable to tolerate prone position due to hemodynamic instability; (2) the patient has any complications such as internal or external hemorrhages and severe skin damages. Continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Comparison of the data between two groups was performed by Mann–Whitney U tests, Fisher’s exact test, and chi-square test using SPSS® Statistics Version 25 (IBM®, Armonk, New York). The value of p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Patients on a stable NVP-containing regimen (>6 months) with a fully suppressed HIV pVL (≤ 50 copies/ml) for more than 24 months were switched to DT with oral NVP (400mg/d) and 3TC (300mg/d). Both compounds were administered once daily with or without food. HIV pVL was monitored monthly until week 24 (COBAS® TaqMan® 48 Analyzer by Roche Diagnostics). The primary outcome was confirmed viral failure (RNA >100 copies/ml) within 24 weeks. To limit the potential harm to patients in particular to prevent the development of resistance in the event of virus failure, a stopping rule was implemented. The study would have been terminated prematurely if two patients would have demonstrated viral failure. In addition, the protocol required a stepwise inclusion: After the five first inclusions further inclusion of five more patients was initiated after all five first patients have reached week 12 without viral failure. When 10 patients reached week 12, the remaining 10 patients were included. After week 24, patients were offered to be further continued on DT and monitored every 8 weeks for another 24 weeks. Subsequently, monitoring was reduced to every 12 weeks until week 96 and every 24 weeks until week 144. The frequency of low-level detection of HIV pVL (<20, 20–50, >50 copies/ml) was compared in each patient with pre-study viral load measurements. Since all patients were also participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), treatment adherence was assessed with the self-report instrument used in the SHCS every 24 weeks. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. This study was approved by the cantonal ethics committee (Ethikkommission Ostschweiz, EKOS, ID: EKOS 2016–01963) and registered (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03223402). All participants provided written informed consent.
We conducted an observational, retrospective study of patients with HIV-1 seen at an urban HIV clinic. A convenience sample of 100 patients that were seen at the clinic between 1 September 2014 and 31 August 2017 were included in the study if they were HIV-infected, 18–89 years of age, on ART, and with at least an M184V/I mutation documented via genotypic resistance tests. Patients were excluded if there was no documented HIV RNA viral load (VL) available in the results section of the electronic medical record within the year prior to study inclusion date or while on current ART. Data collected from patients’ electronic medical record included patient demographic information: age, gender, and race. The HIV data collected included most recent ART and start date, ART within the past 3 months (if different from current ART), most recent VL and CD4 count on current ART, presence of VL >100,000 copies/mL at any point on current ART, CD4 nadir, duration of HIV infection, and presence of concern for non-adherence. Patients were considered to have presence of concern for non-adherence if there was documentation of concern of “non-adherence” or “non-compliance” in the clinic visit notes from the four most recent visits. All documented resistance-conferring HIV mutations, historical and present, were collected from the results section of the patients’ medical records. The primary endpoint for this study was the proportion of patients with viral suppression while on current ART, stratified by the number of active ARVs. Viral suppression was defined as VL < 200 copies/mL at the most recent measurement while on current regimen. Although viral suppression is confirmed by the lower limits of detection of used assays, the definition of virologic failure as defined in the DHHS guidelines was used. This was done to take into consideration any virologic blips that may occur during therapy that would not indicate a change in ART. A single VL value was used because confirmatory VL measurements were not always available given the retrospective nature of the data. The number of active agents was determined based on the genotypic susceptibility score (GSS). The Stanford HIVdb genotypic resistance classification was used to calculate GSS. A GSS of 1 was assigned for drugs deemed susceptible or with potential low-level resistance, while a GSS of 0.5 was assigned to drugs with intermediate or low-level resistance, and a GSS of 0 was assigned to drugs with high-level resistance. Both 3TC and FTC were assigned a GSS of 0 in the presence of an M184V/I mutation. The sum of the GSS for each drug in the regimen was considered as the number of active agents. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients with most recent CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 while on current ART stratified by the number of active ARVs and the proportion of patients on various combinations of ARVs. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics for demographic data. Multivariable analysis was performed to measure the association of all predictors and outcomes. For the multivariable analysis, a logistic regression model was used for outcomes with demographic characteristics. To identify potential confounders, the analysis checked for other factors associated with exposure of interest including age, gender, HIV duration in years, presence of VL >100,000 copies/mL in HIV history, CD4 nadir during treatment history, and presence of concern for non-adherence by using t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Factors with a statistically significant relationship on univariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to measure the associations of outcomes and effects. Analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
To quantify the restored AIRE at the mRNA level, qPCR analysis (see Methods) was performed on thymic lysates of all groups. Four weeks postinjection, AAV9‐mediated gene transfer resulted in a significant increase (P ≤ 0.05) in AIRE mRNA levels in thymic cells compared with PBS and AAV9‐GFP injections and a 1000‐fold change compared with endogenous levels in Aire mice (Aire is expressed but not translated into functional protein in these mice) (Figure 4a; n = 3). To determine whether an increase in Aire‐dependent TSAs followed AIRE overexpression, we tested a panel of well‐established Aire‐dependent TSAs including Ccl1, IL‐3, Ins2, Spt1, Apoa1 and Reg1.
, 
 Indeed, restoration of AIRE levels, mediated by intrathymic AAV injection, resulted in an elevation of expression of all 6 Aire‐dependent TSAs studied (Figure 4a; n = 3). A significant increase was observed in both Ins2 (P < 0.0001) and Spt1 (P < 0.005) when compared to PBS‐treated Aire mice. There was also a significant increase of Ins2 expression in the thymus of AAV9‐AIRE compared to control mice including Aire AAV9‐GFP mice (Figure 4a; n = 3). In contrast, none of the Aire‐independent genes including Cpox, Ncoa6 and Pplb showed significant changes in the level of their expression between the 4 groups of mice (Aire−/−, Aire+/+, Aire−/−AAV9‐GFP and Aire−/−AAV9‐AIRE) (Figure 4b; n = 3). These data indicate that modulation of AIRE in vivo can directly lead to alterations in specific TSA levels and may have the potential to affect the maintenance of central tolerance.
Anti-GAPDH, anti-Hsp90, anti-β-actin, anti-Col І, anti-Col IV, anti-vimentin, anti-α-SMA, anti-fibronectin, and anti-CTGF antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK). Anti-p53, p-Smad3, and Smad3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), while anti-COXIV and TGF-β were obtained from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL, USA). Anti-DsbA-L antibody was provided by Dr. Feng Liu Lab. All secondary antibodies, MitoTracker Green FM and MitoTracker Red CMXRos, were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The cisplatin, aristolochic acid, and Mitochondria Isolation Kit were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). The target sequence for mouse Hsp90β was described as in the previous study. The proximal tubule-specific DabA-L-deletion mice were generated by crossing DsbA-L (flox/flox) mice (provided by Dr. Feng Liu Lab) with PEPCK-Cre mice (provided by Jackson Laboratory) as previously described. The UUO model was established by ligating the left ureter in mice, also as previously described. For ischemic acute kidney injury, it was induced by the duration of bilateral clamping for 28 min and followed by reperfusion. For cisplatin injury, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg cisplatin at weeks 0, 1, and 3. For aristolochic acid injury, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 250 mg/kg aristolochic acid. Hsp90β siRNA was administered twice a week by tail vein injection in C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg, with saline as a control. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines approved by the Animal Care Ethics Committee of Second Xiangya Hospital, People’s Republic of China, and ethical approval was obtained. Mice were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to a standard rodent diet and water. After obtaining protocol approval from the Review Board of Second Xiangya Hospital, People’s Republic of China, kidney biopsy specimens were obtained from patients living with MCD (n = 8) and Ob (n = 8). All MCD patients use biopsy as a clinical diagnostic standard. All organizations obtained the patient’s consent. We declare that all study complies with all relevant ethical regulations for research with human participants and was carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles, and that the study is compliant with the guidance of the Ministry of Science and Technology for the Review and Approval of Human Genetic Resources. MCD: Inclusion criteria: (1) pathologically diagnosed as a patient with clear minimal change diseases; (2) the patient does not have tumor and other kidney diseases; (3) age <75 years old. Exclusion criteria: (1) exclude patients with multiple renal tumors, central renal tumors, and other kidney diseases; (2) exclude patients with solitary kidneys (anatomically or functionally); (3) exclude patients whose blood creatinine is already abnormal in preoperative examination (male > 104.0 μmol/l; female > 87.1 μmol/l); exclude patients with other diseases (kidney stones, ureteral stones, etc.) who need other operations at the same time. Ob: Inclusion criteria: (1) computed tomography confirmed severe unilateral renal hydronephrosis, (2) intravenous pyelography examination of hydronephrosis or not, but the opposite kidney was normal; (3) serum creatinine was normal; (4) postoperative medical examination was confirmed to be a pure hydronephrosis patient; (5) age <75 years old. Exclusion criteria: (1) exclude patients with tumors found in postoperative medical examinations, (2) exclude patients whose blood creatinine is already abnormal in preoperative examinations; (3) exclude patients with a history of diabetes, gout, hypertension, urinary tuberculosis, or infection. These were then used for HE staining, Masson’s trichome staining, IP, and Western immunoblot staining. The BUMPT cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plasmids (HA-Dox-Teton-Hsp90β-NTD-1–220, HA-Dox-Teton-Hsp90β-NTD + Link-1–275, HA-Dox-Teton-Hsp90β-NTD + Link-1+MD-1–545, HA-Dox-Teton-Hsp90β-NTD + Link-1+MD + CTD-1–690, and HA-Dox-Teton-Hsp90β-1–724, HA-Hsp90β-Δ546–552, HA-Hsp90β-Δ545–690, and Hsp90β-Δ545–690) were transfected into BUMPT cells by lipofection. Twenty-four hours after transfection of DsbA-L siRNA, Hsp90β siRNA, negative control, or DsbA-L plasmid, BUMPT cells were subjected to starvation in a serum-free medium overnight and then were treated with or without TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for another 24 h, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin as a control. For the co-culture experiment, BUMPT cells were transfected with the plasmid of DsbA-L or control plus with or without CTGF-neutralizing antibody. After culturing with free serum for 24 h, the supernatant was collected and then transferred to culture with mouse kidney fibroblasts (Procell, CP-M069, Wuhan, China) for 24 h. Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was performed to extract total RNA from BUMPT cells, and kidney of C57BL/6J mice according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Briefly, total RNA (40 ng) was reverse transcribed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time qPCR was carried out to detect the expression levels of DsbA-L and GAPDH using Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) IQ SYBR Green Supermix with Opticon (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described. The primers used were as follows: DabA-L: 5′-AAATATGGGGCCTTTGGGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGCAACTCCAAGCGGTCAG-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH: 5′-GGTCTCCTCTGACTTCACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGAGGGT CTCTCTCTTCCT-3′ (reverse). We used in silico approaches to identify potential functional domains that mediate the interaction between HSP90 and DsbAL. We used the sequence search in the RCSB PDB database to identify the PDB files of HSP90 dimer (ID: 2CG9) and DsbAL dimer (ID: 1YZX). Sequence analyses showed a high similarity between human and mouse sequences for HSP90 and DsbAL (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Second, given the extracted PDB as inputs, Cluspro V2.0 (http://cluspro.bu.edu/) was conducted to estimate structural interfaces that potentially mediate the protein interactions. A collection of 120 models was therefore obtained with the indication of potential interactions within the N-terminal domain, central domain, or C-terminal domain of HSP90. Third, we mapped the functional domains and performed cell-line experiments to validate the exact domains that mediated the HSP90–DsbAL interaction. Fourth, structural visualization and movies were prepared using PyMOL V2.1 (http://www.pymol.org/). A Mitochondria Isolation Kit was used to isolate the mitochondria from BUMPT cells and kidney tissues following the standard procedure. The model of Hsp90 and DabA-L was described in Supplementary Methods. The IP buffer was used to lyse cells and was followed by IP using antibodies, including Hsp90, DsbA-L, and HA. Immunoprecipitates were resolved to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblot. Kidney tissues were harvested and observed using HE and Masson’s trichrome stainings. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using anti-DsbA-L (1:50), Col I (1:100), Col III (1:100), and α-SMA (1:100) according to the previous protocol. The immunofluorescence of DsbA-L and Hsp90 was carried out following the standard procedure. Mitochondrial staining followed the standard operating procedure. The methods of quantitation have been described in our previous work. Protein lysates from BUMPT cells or kidneys were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then to immunoblot analysis to detect the expression of DsbA-L, Hsp90, p-Smad3, Smad3, p53, Col I, Col III, α-SMA, TGF-β, and CTGF following the standard procedure. All data were presented as means ± s.d. Two group comparisons were made using two-tailed Student’s t tests. Multiple group comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
Full details on molecule synthesis are provided in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs. 7–18. The following cell lines were employed in this study: 293T (source: ATCC #CRL-3216, media: DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin), 293FT (source: Thermo Fisher Scientific #R70007, media: DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin), PATU-8902 (source: DSMZ #ACC-179, media: DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin), MV4;11 (source: ATCC #CRL-9591, media: RPMI with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin) and EWS502 (source: kindly provided by Dr. Stephen L. Lessnick of Nationwide Children’s Hospital and established by Dr. Jonathan A. Fletcher of Harvard Medical School, media: RPMI with 15% FBS and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin-l-Glutamine). Development of engineered cell lines are detailed below. All cell lines were maintained in 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubators and routinely tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert Kit (Lonza). To generate pLEX_305-dTAG-GFP and pLEX_305-dTAG-EWS/FLI plasmids, gateway recombination cloning strategies (Invitrogen) were employed to clone GFP or EWS/FLI into pLEX_305-N-dTAG. In brief, to first generate pDONR221-EWS/FLI, EWS/FLI was cloned into pDONR221 using BP clonase (Invitrogen) after PCR with the following primers containing BP overhangs: Forward-N-E/F-dTAG, 5′-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggcttcgcgtccacggattacagtacct-3′ and Reverse-N-E/F-dTAG, 5′-ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtcctagtagtagctgcctaagtgtgaaggc-3′. Second, pENTREGFP2 (Addgene #22450) and pDONR221-EWS/FLI were cloned into pLEX_305-N-dTAG using LR clonase (Invitrogen). pLEX_305-dTAG-KRASG12V and pLEX_305-LACZ-dTAG plasmids were also employed in this study. pXPR007-sgGFP and pXPR007-sgKRAS were employed in this study. To generate lentiCRISPR v2-Blast-sgFLI_Ex9, sgFLI_Ex9 (5′-GCCTCACGGCGTGCAGGAAG-3′) was cloned into lentiCRISPR v2-Blast vector (Addgene #83480) using BsmbI restriction sites. The PAM motif of sgFLI_Ex9 is present in an intron, enabling cutting of the endogenous locus only with cDNA rescue. To generate 293TWT FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V and 293TVHL−/− FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V cells, concentrated lentiviral supernatants were applied to 293TWT and 293TVHL−/− cells in the presence of 4 µg mL−1 polybrene and transduced cell lines were selected with 2 µg mL−1 puromycin. To generate EWS502 FKBP12F36V-GFP cells, EWS502 cells were transduced with pLEX_305-dTAG-GFP lentiviral supernatant and selected with 1 µg mL−1 puromycin. To generate EWS502 FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI; EWS/FLI−/− cells, EWS502 cells were co-transduced with pLEX_305-dTAG-EWS/FLI and lentiCRISPR v2-Blast-sgFLI_Ex9 lentiviral supernatants. Cells were then selected with both 1 µg mL−1 puromycin (pLEX_305-dTAG-EWS/FLI) and 5 µg mL−1 blasticidin (lentiCRISPR v2-Blast-sgFLI_Ex9). Knockout of endogenous EWS/FLI and the expression of exogenous FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI were confirmed by immunoblot and pooled transduced cell populations were employed for this study. PATU-8902 LACZ-FKBP12F36V and FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V; KRAS−/− clones were also employed in this study. Dual luciferase assays were performed using 293FT FKBP12WT-Nluc and FKBP12F36V-Nluc cells. In brief, cells were plated at 2000 cells per well in 20 µL of appropriate media in 384-well white culture plates (Corning), allowed to adhere overnight, and 100 nL of compounds were added using a Janus Workstation pin tool (PerkinElmer) for 24 h at 37 °C. To evaluate Fluc signal, plates were brought to room temperature, 20 µL of Dual-Glo Reagent (Promega) was added for 10 min and luminescence was measured on an Envision 2104 plate reader (PerkinElmer). Subsequently, 20 µL of Dual-Glo Stop & Glo Reagent (Promega) was added for 10 min and luminescence was again measured to capture Nluc signal. DMSO-normalized ratios of Nluc/Fluc signal was analyzed and plotted using GraphPad PRISM v8. PATU-8902 LACZ-FKBP12F36V and FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V; KRAS−/− cells and 293T cells were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitors (Roche), PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), and 0.1% benzonase (Novagen). Proteins were separated using NuPAGE BoltTM Bis–Tris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T, incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labeled infrared secondary antibodies, washed again three times with TBS-T, and assessed using an Odyssey CLx Imager (LI-COR). EWS502 cells were lysed with Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitors (Roche). Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, which were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Membranes were washed five times with TBS-T, incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed again five times with TBS-T, and imaged. The following primary antibodies were employed in this study: HA (Cell Signaling Technology #3724 and #2367, dilution at 1:1000), phospho-ERK1/2 T202/Y204 (Cell Signaling Technology #4370, dilution at 1:1000), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology #4696, dilution at 1:1000), phospho-AKT S473 (Cell Signaling Technology #4060, dilution at 1:1000), AKT (Cell Signaling Technology #2920, dilution at 1:1000), FKBP12 (Abcam #ab24373, dilution at 1:1000), GFP (Cell Signaling Technology #2555, dilution at 1:1000), FLI (Abcam #ab15289, dilution at 1:2000), NKX2-2 (Abcam #ab187375, dilution at 1:1000), GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology #2118, dilution at 1:3000), Vinculin (Cell Signaling Technology #13901, dilution at 1:3000), β-Actin (Cell Signaling Technology #58169, dilution at 1:3000), and α-Tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology #3873, dilution at 1:5000). Species-specific fluorescently labeled infrared secondary antibodies including IRDye 680LT anti-Mouse IgG (LI-COR #926-68020, dilution at 1:5000), IRDye 800CW anti-Mouse IgG (LI-COR #926-32210, dilution at 1:5000), IRDye 680LT anti-Rabbit IgG (LI-COR #926-68021, dilution at 1:5000), and IRDye 800CW anti-Rabbit IgG (LI-COR #926-32211, dilution at 1:5000) and peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies including anti-Mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific #45000680, dilution at 1:5000) and anti-Rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific #45000682, dilution at 1:5000) were employed as appropriate. Cell viability was assayed in 2D-adherent or ultra-low adherent 3D-spheroids using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). Luminescence was measured on an Envision 2104 plate reader (PerkinElmer) and Fluostar Omega Reader (BMG Labtech) and data was analyzed using GraphPad PRISM v8. Synergy assessments were performed using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) with the following modifications to the protocol described in the ref. . In brief, EWS502 cells were plated at 1000 cells per well in 50 µL of appropriate media in 384-well white culture plates (Corning) allowed to adhere overnight, and 100 nL of compounds were added using a Janus Workstation pin tool (PerkinElmer) for 72 h. Cell viability was measured by addition of 10 µL of CellTiter-glo (Promega), followed by incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature. Luminescence was measured on an Envision 2104 plate reader (PerkinElmer) and data was analyzed using GraphPad PRISM v8. The following reagents were employed: Isobaric TMT reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific), BCA protein concentration assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Empore-C18 material for in-house made StageTips (3 M), Sep-Pak cartridges (100 mg, Waters), solvents for Liquid chromatography (LC) (J.T. Baker), mass spectrometry (MS)-grade trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Lys-C protease (Wako), and cOmplete protease inhibitors (Millipore Sigma). Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Cell pellets from PATU-8902 and EWS502 cells were lysed using 8 M urea, 200 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid (EPPS) at pH 8.5 with protease inhibitors. Samples were further homogenized and DNA was sheered via sonication using a probe sonicator (20 × 0.5 s pulses; level 3). Total protein was determined using a BCA assay and stored at −80 °C until future use. A total of 100 µg of protein was aliquoted for each condition and TMT channel for further downstream processing. Protein extracts were reduced using 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at room temperature. Next, samples were alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. To facilitate the removal of incompatible reagents, proteins were precipitated using chloroform methanol. Briefly, to 100 µL of each sample, 400 µL of methanol was added, followed by 100 µL of chloroform with thorough vortexing. Next, 300 µL of HPLC grade water was added and samples were vortexed thoroughly. Each sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The upper aqueous layer was removed and the protein pellet was washed twice with methanol and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Protein pellets were resolubilized in 200 mM EPPS buffer and digested overnight with Lys-C (1:100, enzyme:protein ratio) at room temperature. The next day, trypsin (1:100 ratio) was added and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 6 h in a ThermoMixer set to 1000 RPM. To each digested sample, 30% anhydrous acetonitrile was added and 100 µg of peptides were labeled using 200 µg of TMT reagent (TMT1-TMT11). Following labeling, a 5% hydroxylamine solution was used to quench excess TMT reagent. To equalize protein loading, a ratio check was performed by pooling 2 µg of each TMT-labeled sample. Samples were pooled and desalted using in-house packed C18 StageTips and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Normalization factors were calculated from this label check, samples were mixed 1:1 across all TMT channels and desalted using a 100 mg Sep-Pak solid phase extraction cartridge. Eluted pooled peptides were further fractionated with basic-pH reverse-phase (bRP) HPLC using an Agilent 300 extend C18 column and collected into a 96 deep-well plate. Samples were consolidated into 24 fractions, and 12 nonadjacent fraction were desalted using StageTips prior to analyses using LC-MS/MS. All mass spectrometry data was acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer in-line with a Proxeon NanoLC-1000 UHPLC system. Peptides were separated using an in-house 100 µm capillary column packed with 40 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 µm, 150 Å) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 180 min LC gradient per fraction. Eluted peptides were acquired using synchronous precursor selection (SPS-MS3) method for TMT quantification. Briefly, MS1 spectra were acquired at 120 K resolving power with a maximum of 50 ms in the Orbitrap. MS2 spectra were acquired by selecting the top ten most abundant features via collisional induced dissociation (CID) in the ion trap using an automatic gain control (AGC) of 15 K, quadrupole isolation width of 0.7 m/z and a maximum ion time of 100 ms. For MS3 acquisition, a synchronous precursor selection of ten fragment ions was acquired with an AGC of 150 K for 150 ms and a normalized collision energy of 55. All acquired raw data were converted to mzXML using Raw File Reader (v3.0.77). Spectra were processed using Comet (2019.01.5), search results were filtered using the LDA function MASS Package in R, and data were processed using an in-house informatics pipeline. Custom code was not developed in this study. Briefly, peptide spectral libraries were first filtered to a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% using linear discriminant analysis employing a target decoy strategy. Spectral searches were performed using a 2020 Uniprot Human database including canonical isoforms (96,788 total entries) fasta formatted database which included custom sequences for LACZ-FKBP12F36V and FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI, common contaminants, reversed sequences (Uniprot Human, 2020) and the following parameters: 50 ppm precursor tolerance, fully tryptic peptides, fragment ion tolerance of 0.9 Da and a static modification of TMT (+229.163 Da) on lysine and peptide N-termini, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.021 Da) were set as static modifications, while oxidation of methionine residues (+15.995 Da) was set as a variable modification. Resulting peptides were further filtered to obtain a 1% protein FDR and proteins were collapsed into groups. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for impurities during synthesis of different TMT reagents according to the manufacturer’s specifications. For quantitation, a total sum signal-to-noise of all report ions of 100 was required for analysis, isolation specificity at the MS2 and MS3 level >0.50 and no missing values (11/11 TMT channels). Protein quantitative values were normalized (column normalization) so that the sum of the signal for all protein in each channel was equal to account for sample loading. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics raw data files have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (PXD018937). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed as indicated in the figure legends. For IP injections, dTAG-13 and dTAGV-1 were formulated by dissolving into DMSO and then diluting with 20% solutol (Sigma): 0.9% sterile saline (Moltox) (w:v) with the final formulation containing 5% DMSO. Maximal solubility of 35 mg kg−1 and 40 mg kg−1 were observed for dTAG-13 and dTAGV-1, respectively. Formulations were stable at room temperature for 7 days. For IV injections, dTAG-13 and dTAGV-1 were formulated by dissolving into DMSO and then diluting with 5% solutol (Sigma): 0.9% sterile saline (Moltox) (w:v) with the final formulation containing 5% DMSO. All procedures for PK studies were compliant with ethical regulations for animal testing and research, and were approved by and performed in accordance with standards of the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Scripps Florida. Housing conditions for mice at Scripps Florida were as follows: lights on = 7 AM, lights off = 7 PM, average ambient temperature = 72 °F, and average humidity = 45%. PK was assessed in 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratory, #000664) with blood collected at 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h (2 mg kg−1 dTAG-13 intravenous (IV) tail vein, 10 mg kg−1 dTAG-13 intraperitoneal (IP), and 2 mg kg−1 dTAGV-1 IV tail vein administrations) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h (2 mg kg−1 dTAGV-1 IP and 10 mg kg−1 dTAGV-1 IP administrations). Plasma was generated by centrifugation and plasma concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS following the mass transition 49600à340 AMU. PK parameters were calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin to determine peak plasma concentration (Cmax), oral bioavailability (%F), exposure (AUC), half-life (t1/2), clearance (CL), and volume of distribution (Vd). All procedures for PD studies were compliant with ethical regulations for animal testing and research, and were approved by and performed in accordance with standards of the IACUC at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute. Housing conditions for mice at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute were as follows: lights on = 6 AM, lights off = 6 PM, average ambient temperature = 72 °F, and average humidity = 35–55%. Evaluation of degradation of luciferase in vivo was performed using MV4;11 luc-FKBP12F36V cells and bioluminescent measurements. In brief, 250,000 viable MV4;11 luc-FKBP12F36V cells were transplanted by tail-vein injection in 8-week-old immunocompromised female mice (NOD.Cg-PrkdcIl2rg/SzJ, NSG; Jackson Laboratory, #005557). Bioluminescent measurements were performed following IP injection of 75 mg kg−1
d-Luciferin (Promega). Mice were then anesthetized with 2−3% isoflurane, imaged on an IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences), and total body bioluminescence was determined using a standardized region of interest. Two and seven days after tail-vein injection, bioluminescent measurements were performed to confirm engraftment. Detectable bioluminescent signal in the cohort was observed at day 7 and was used as the baseline signal for each mouse. For treatments, compounds were formulated as described above, administered via IP injection and bioluminescent measurements were performed daily as described in Fig. 2d, beginning 8 days after tail-vein injection. Information regarding center values, error bars, number of replicates or samples, number of independent experiments, and statistical analyses are described in the corresponding figure legends and data files. Experiments were not blinded nor randomized, and sample sizes were not predetermined using statistical analyses. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
A microbial consortium called SEM1b was obtained from a biogas reactor using serial dilution and enrichment methods on spruce cellulose. Metagenomic analysis was initially performed on the SEM1b community using two different generations that had consistent population structure and was used as a supporting database for a subsequent SEM1b time-series experiment. The time series analyses consisted of metabolomics, metaproteomics, and metatranscriptomics over nine time points (at t0, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, and 43 h) in triplicate (A, B, and C), spanning the consortium life cycle (Fig. 1b). For every time point (60 ml), a 6 and 30 ml aliquot was collected and used for MT and MP analysis, respectively. The RNA internal standard was added to the 6 ml aliquot and the resulting transcript levels were therefore multiplied by 10 to reconstruct the original 60 ml sample size (3× replicates). In the case of the MP analysis, the proteins were extracted from the 30 ml aliquot, and the protein concentration calculated using the Bradford method from which we computed the original mass of protein in the 60 ml sample (3× replicates). Therefore, the number of transcripts and proteins used in the paper refers to the whole consortium contained within each culture flask. For the generation of metagenomic data, 6 ml samples of SEM1b culture were taken and cells were pelleted prior to storage at −20 °C. A cell pellet was produced by centrifugation of 2 ml of samples at 14,000×g for 5 min. Pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RBB + C buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl; 50 mM EDTA, 4% SDS) and incubated for 20 min at 70 °C. NaCl solution was used to reach 0.7 M and 1:10 volume of CTAB buffer was added before an additional incubation at 70 °C for 10 min. An equal volume of Chloroform is then added and centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 15 min. The aqueous phase was retrieved and an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) was added and centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 15 min. The aqueous phase was retrieved one more time and 2 volumes of 95% ethanol were added and gently mixed until the DNA spooled and could be transferred with a sterile loop to a tube containing 200 µl of 70% ethanol. After centrifugation at 14,000 rcf for 2 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet air-dried prior to being resuspended into 30 µl of TE buffer (pH 8.0). DNA samples were prepared with the TrueSeq DNA PCR-free preparation and sequenced with paired-ends (2 × 125 bp) on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq3000 platform (Illumina Inc) at the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC, Oslo, Norway). The reads were 3′-trimmed (Phred < 20, length > 100) with cutadapt and filtered using FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) to retain the reads with Phred > 30 on at least 90% of their length. The reads were mapped (ID = 100%) on two Coprothermobacter proteolyticus isolates from SEM1b using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner with maximal exact matches (BWA-MEM). The remaining reads were assembled with MetaSpades v 3.10.0 (k-mers: 21, 33, 55, 77) and the contigs binned with Metabat v0.26.3 (in “very sensitive mode”). The contigs were also uploaded to the Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes system for gene prediction and annotation. Resulting annotated open reading frames (ORFs) were retrieved and used as a reference database for the metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analysis. mRNA extraction was performed in triplicate on time points t2–t8. The extraction of the mRNA included the addition of an in vitro transcribed RNA as an internal standard to estimate the number of transcripts in the natural sample compared with the number of transcripts sequenced. For further normalization, total RNA was extracted using enzymatic lysis and mechanical disruption of the cells and purified with the RNeasy mini kit (Protocol 2, Qiagen, USA). The RNA standard (25 ng) was added at the beginning of the extraction in every sample. After purification, residual DNA was removed using the Turbo DNA Free kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Free nucleotides and small RNAs such as tRNAs were cleaned off with a lithium chloride precipitation solution according to ThermoFisher Scientific’s recommendations (https://www.thermofisher.com/be/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/rna-isolation/general-articles/the-use-of-licl-precipitation-for-rna-purification.html) Briefly, one volume of cold 5 M LiCl solution was added to the samples, mixed well, and incubated at −20 °C for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded and the pellets were washed with 70% ethanol prior to being resuspended in 16 µl of RNase-free water. To reduce the number of rRNAs, the samples were treated to enrich for mRNAs using the MICROBExpress kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). The successful rRNA depletion was confirmed by analyzing both pre- and post-treated samples on a 2100 bioanalyzer instrument. The enriched mRNA was amplified with the MessageAmp II-Bacteria Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruction and sent for sequencing at the NSC (Oslo, Norway). Samples were subjected to the TruSeq stranded RNA sample preparation, which included the production of a cDNA library, and sequenced with paired-end technology (2 × 125 bp) on one lane of a HiSeq3000 system. The resulting sequences were checked for overrepresented features with FastQC (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/); features and low qualities (Phred < 20) ends were trimmed using Trimmomatic v.0.36. The reads were then filtered using an average Phred >20 in a 10nt window and a minimum length of 100 nt. The rRNA and tRNA reads were removed using SortMeRNA v2.1b. Also, the reads mapping on the internal standard pGEM-3Z were extracted using SortMeRNA, and their counts used as IR in the “Functional omics absolute quantification” section of the “Methods”, while the reads that did not map (i.e., the transcriptome in the sample) were used as ∑TR. The retained reads were mapped against the predicted genes-data set using Kallisto pseudo –pseudobam and the mapping files were produced with bam2hits. Transcripts were quantified with mmseq and collapsed using mmcollapse. The collapse first gathers ORFs into groups if they have 100% sequence identity, and in a second round the ORFs (already termed ORFGs) are collapsed if they acquire unique hits as a group. A summary of the filtering and mapping output is summarized in Supplementary Data 6 and 7, respectively. Proteins were extracted from t1 to t8 in triplicate. From each sample, 30 ml of culture containing cells and substrate was centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min to pellet the substrate. The supernatant was centrifuged at 9000×g for 15 min to collect the cells. Cell lysis was performed by resuspending the cells in 1 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA) and keeping them on ice for 30 min. Cells were disrupted in 3 × 60 s cycles using a FastPrep24 (MP Biomedicals, USA) with glass beads (size, ≤106 μm). Debris were removed by centrifugation at 16,000×g for 15 min. The supernatants containing the proteins were kept at −20 °C until further processing. Extracted proteins were quantified using Bradford’s method (in triplicate), which quantified the samples by combining 2–10 µl of protein extract with 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5) to reach 800 µl, with 200 µl of BioRad Essay solution subsequently added. Samples were vortexed, centrifuged briefly, and let to rest for 5 min before measuring with dedicated cuvettes. Blanks composed of 800 µl of buffer and 200 µl of BioRad Essay solution were used before each set of measurements. 50 μg of each sample were denatured using SDS sample buffer and loaded on an Any-kD Mini-PROTEAN gel (BioRad Laboratories, USA) and separated by SDS-PAGE for 20 min at 270 V. Each gel lane was cut into 16 slices and the reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion of the proteins into peptides were performed in-gel. It is important to note that previous reports have shown that absolute protein quantification may be biased by the protease selected for digestion. While ideally, more than one protease could have been used, we have used trypsin in our analysis (which is commonplace in most proteomics experiments) and obtained a high correlation of absolute protein quantification between replicates (average R2 = 0.85, with the outlier t7C removed). Moreover, the protein-to-RNA ratios observed for the different bacteria and archaea correlate well with previous literature (E. coli, yeast, human), indicating that our absolute quantifications are on par. The tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel and desalted prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Peptides were analyzed using a nanoLC-MS/MS system consisting of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (ThermoScientific, Germany) connected to a Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific, Germany) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. The samples were loaded onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap100, C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 300 μm i.d. ×5 mm, ThermoScientific) and backflushed onto a 50-cm analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18, 2 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm ID, ThermoScientific). At the start, the columns were in 96% solution A [0.1% (v/v) formic acid], 4% solution B [80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid]. The peptides were eluted using a 90 min gradient developing from 4 to 13% (v/v) solution B in 2 min, 13 to 45% (v/v) B in 70 min, and finally to 55% B in 5 min before the wash phase at 90% B, all at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode and the 10 most intense peptide precursors ions were selected for fragmentation and MS/MS acquisition. The selected precursor ions were then excluded for repeated fragmentation for 20 s. The resolution was set to R = 70,000 and R = 35,000 for MS and MS/MS, respectively. A total of 384 raw MS files (8 samples × 3 biological replicates × 16 fractions) were analyzed using MaxQuant version 1.4.1.2 and proteins were identified and quantified using the MaxLFQ algorithm. The data were searched against the generated MG data set supplemented with common contaminants such as human keratin and bovine serum albumin. In addition, reversed sequences of all protein entries were concatenated to the database for the estimation of false discovery rates. The tolerance levels for matching to the database was 6 ppm for MS and 20 ppm for MS/MS. Trypsin was used as a digestion enzyme, and two missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification and protein N-terminal acetylation, oxidation of methionines, deamidation of asparagines and glutamines, and formation of pyro-glutamic acid at N-terminal glutamines were allowed as variable modifications. The “match between runs” feature of MaxQuant was applied. When proteins cannot be unambiguously identified with unique peptides, MaxQuant will group them and quantify them together as one ORFG. All identifications were filtered in order to achieve a protein false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Quantitative information was retrieved using the LFQ intensities of each protein. For monosaccharide detection, 2 ml samples were taken in triplicates, filtered, and sterilized with 0.2 µm sterile filters, and 15 min boiling. Soluble sugars were identified and quantified by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed amperiometric detection (PAD). For quantification, peaks were compared to linear standard curves generated with known concentrations of selected monosaccharides (glucose, xylose, mannose, arabinose, and galactose) in the range of 0.001–0.1 g/l. For the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 1 ml was taken in triplicate from each time point, they were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatants were filtered with 0.2 μm sterile filters. 5 µl of sulfuric acid 72% were added to the filtrates and let at rest for 2 min before being centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 5 min, transferred in a new tube, and stored at −20 °C until processing. SCFAs were then measured at 210 nm using a Dionex 3000 HPLC with a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column from Agilent Technologies (150 × 2.1 mm (3.5 mm particles)) and operated at 40 °C. The VFAs were eluted isocratically with 100% methanol and 2.5 mM H2SO4 at 0.3 ml/min flow rate. The absolute quantification of transcripts was taken from Mortazavi et al. using the internal standard from Gifford et al. as a reference to estimate the length of the initial transcriptome. The number of reads produced in a given sample is proportional to the total amount (in Nt) of starting material. With the addition of an internal standard we have the following proportion between the starting material for transcripts expressed in nucleotide length (TNt) and the internal standard (INt) and the reads they produce (TR and IR, respectively): in which the sums are taken over a single sample. The formula can be rearranged as: Since we know the number of molecules of internal standard added (IM) and its length (INt), we can substitute them in the equation as: We can now use the estimation of the starting length of the transcriptome and the RPMK transcript measurements in the formula from Mortazavi et al.:which becomes: The “Total protein approach” method from Wiśniewski et al. relies on the use of the protein mass per sample, the computed molecular weight (MW) of the detected proteins to transform the LFQ values into absolute ones. Here we omitted the per-cell quantification since SEM1b is a heterogeneous community and MG measurements were not taken for the time series. We computed the Total protein as: Then the Protein concentrationi was obtained from the previous with: The method was developed on the assumption that the reference proteome is complete and that the total mass of the peptides detected is equal to the total mass of peptides processed by the machine. This is not necessarily valid in a microbiome for which the reference cannot be completely reliable. Knowing the Total protein mass [g] per sample, computed from the protein concentration estimated with the Bradford assay and the starting volume of the sample (60 ml), we estimated the Detected protein mass [g] (i.e., how much of protein mass is explained by the peaks recognized during MP analysis) using the raw MP files with the following formula:where the Base peak intensity and Mass correspond to the homologous values for the ith identified peak (i.e., a peak with an amino acid sequence associated, thus it can be called a peptide) in the raw MP files. Finally, the copy number of proteins per sample was computed using the Avogadro’s number (NA) as: The MT and MP data sets estimate the absolute abundance of ORFGs over time. An expression group is defined in this study as a set of ORFs, which cannot be further resolved using the available data. When the analysis required the direct comparison of ORFs (e.g., transcript–protein correlation and protein-to-RNA ratios) only the singleton subset of the ORFGs was considered. The subset may suffer marginally from a loss in data points (ORFs), however the genomes in which this phenomenon had a larger impact (COPR2-3, BWF2A, and SW3C) were not used to estimate numerical properties such as protein-to-RNA ratios and k values. In addition, the impact of data loss for the aforementioned MAGs/strains was illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2 and did not outline any clear distribution that was opposing the observations made for the MAGs used in this study. The reliability of the expression estimation is linked to the number of unique hits (reads or peptides) available for a given ORF, therefore all the entries with 0 unique hits were filtered out. The data sets were then log10-transformed with a pseudocount equal to one. After expression density plotting, the minimum expression thresholds of 5 and 8 were selected for MT and MP, respectively, and the data were filtered accordingly. The principal component analysis was used to screen the samples and t7C (time point 7, replicate C) was identified as an outlier and removed before downstream analysis. We took the intersection of ORFs present in the MT and MP layers of the data set for each of the selected MAGs (COPR1, CLOS1, COPR1, METH1, RCLO1, TEPI1, TEPI2, TISS1), and, for each sample, we performed a regression analysis in R. The values span several orders of magnitudes, thus we decided to fit the monomial functional:which can be rewritten as:to be more easily fitted as a linear model. The previously log10-transformed protein levels were used as y while the log10-transformed RNA was used as x in a linear model using the lm function. The slopes of the models were then used to fit a third-grade polynomial function to obtain the k value change profile in Fig. 2d. The KEGG Orthology (KO) numbers were assigned to the ORFs as a part of the annotation pipeline from IMG. The ORF-wise annotation was then translated into the MT/MP-ORFGs assigning to each ORFG a non-redundant set of all the terms assigned to all the ORFs in the group. We used the KO numbers to estimate the KEGG module completeness using the R package MetaQy v.1.1.0. The Glycosyl Hydrolases annotation was retrieved from Kunath et al.. The metabolic marker genes for Fig. 2 were selected with the following criterion. Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis: an enzyme with irreversible reactions. PPP: genes involved in the main interconversion loop between ribose-5 phosphate and fructose-6 phosphate. Wood–Ljungdahl pathway: marker genes from Can et al.. Methanogenesis: markers genes from Scheller et al.. The glycosyl hydrolases were manually curated to assemble a set able to perform the substrate conversion. We ran PECA-R to estimate translation and protein degradation rates using the absolute quantification tables for transcripts and proteins with default parameters. The rates are estimated between two consecutive time points, therefore the sample from 8 h was not included because it is missing the corresponding MT data. We filtered the results to identify the changing point using a score threshold of 0.9 and an FDR equal to 0.05.

Thalidomide (Tokyo Chemical Industry), pomalidomide (Sigma–Aldrich), lenalidomide (FujiFilm Wako), 5-hydroxythalidomide (5-HT, synthesized as previously reported), MG132 (Peptide Institute), MLN4924 (Chemscene), cycloheximide (Merck Millipore), and zVAD-FMK (Peptide Institute) were dissolved in DMSO (FujiFilm Wako) at 2–100 mM and stored at −20 °C as stock solutions. All drugs were diluted 1000-fold for in vivo experiments or 200-fold for in vitro experiments. 2′,3′-cGAMP (InvivoGen) was dissolved in endotoxin-free water. Recombinant human TNF-α (R&D Systems) was reconstituted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were used in this study: FLAG (Sigma–Aldrich, A8592, 1:5,000), AGIA (produced in our laboratory, 1:10,000), α-tubulin (MBL, PM054-7, 1:10,000), and biotin (Cell Signaling Technology, #7075, 1:5,000). The following primary antibodies were used in this study: CRBN (#71810, 1:1000), IκBα (#4814, 1:1000), phospho-IκBα (#9246, 1:1000), NF-κB1 p105/p50 (#12540, 1:1000), p65 (RelA) (#8242, 1:1000), phospho-p65 (RelA) (#3033, 1:1000), CYLD (#8462, 1:1000), RIP1 (#3493, 1:1000), caspase-8 (#9746, 1:1000), caspase-3 (#9662, 1:1000), PARP (#9542, 1:1000), FADD (#2782, 1:1000), phospho-TBK1 (#5483, 1:1000), and TBK1 (#3504, 1:1000) (all from Cell Signaling Technology); and lamin B (#sc-6217, 1:500) (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-rabbit IgG (HRP-conjugated, Cell Signaling Technology, #7074, 1:10,000), anti-mouse IgG (HRP-conjugated, Cell Signaling Technology, #7076, 1:10,000), and anti-goat IgG (HRP-conjugated, Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, #81-1620, 1:10,000) were used as secondary antibodies. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk (Megmilk Snow Brand) in TBST [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween20] at room temperature for 1 h, and then treated with the appropriate antibodies. Immobilon (Millipore) or Immuno-Star LD (FujiFilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) was used as a substrate for HRP, and the luminescent signal was detected on an ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini (GE Healthcare). In some blots, the membrane was stripped with Stripping Solution (FujiFilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and reprobed with other antibodies. HEK293T or HeLa cells were cultured in low-glucose DMEM (FujiFilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FujiFilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. HEK293T or HeLa cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio) or Polyethyleneimine (PEI) Max (MW 40,000) (PolyScience, Inc.). CRBN-KO HEK293T cells were generated by genome editing using CRISPR/CAS9 system. The guide nucleotide sequence 5´-ACTCCGGGCGGTTACCAGGC- 3´ in the human CRBN gene was inserted into the Guide-It plasmid vector (Takara Bio). HEK293T cells were cultured in six-well plates and transfected with the plasmid for 2 days. Then, GFP-positive cells were sorted on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences), and cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution. Genomic DNA was then isolated, and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing after TA cloning (Toyobo). The pDONR221, pcDNA3.1(+), and pCAGGS plasmids were purchased from Invitrogen or Riken, and the pEU vector for the wheat cell-free system was constructed in our laboratory, as previously described. The pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-GW, pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-MCS, pEU-bls-GW, pEU-FLAG-GST-MCS, pCAGGS-MCS-S4D-AGIA, pCAGGS-MCS-(IKZF3 degron)-AGIA, and pCAGGS-S4D-MCS-AGIA plasmids were constructed by PCR and by using the In-Fusion system (Takara Bio) or PCR and restriction enzymes. The SALL4 gene sequence was purchased from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The Venus and SALL4 sequences were amplified, and restriction enzyme sites were added by PCR and cloned into pEU-FLAG-GST-MCS. The pEU-FLAG-GST-Venus-m1, -m2, and -m3 plasmids were constructed by inverse PCR from the pEU-FLAG-GST-Venus-SALL4 plasmid. Venus-m1, -m2, and -m3 were digested by restriction enzymes from pEU-FLAG-GST-Venus-m1, -m2, and -m3, and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-MCS. Venus was also cloned into the pCAGGS-MCS-S4D-AGIA, pCAGGS-S4D-MCS-AGIA, and pCAGGS-MCS-IKZF3 degron (I3D)-AGIA plasmids using restriction enzymes. The open reading frames (ORFs) of CRBN, RELA (RelA), NFKBIA (IκBα), DRD1, and TP53 (p53) were purchased from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC), while the ORF of STING was purchased from Promega (Flexi Clone). The ORF of MAVS was provided by Dr. Youichi Suzuki. CRBN was amplified, and the BP reaction sequence (attB and attP) was added by PCR and cloned into pDONR221 using BP recombination (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, pDONR221-CRBN was recombined into pEU-bls-GW or pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-GW using LR recombination (attL and attR). RelA, IκBα, and sfGFP were amplified, and restriction enzyme sites were added by PCR. Then, RelA-sfGFP and IκBα-sfGFP were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-MCS, and the S4D tag was added to the plasmids pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-RelA-sfGFP and pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-IκBα-sfGFP using inverse PCR. p53, DRD1, STING, and MAVS were amplified, and restriction enzyme sites were added by PCR. They were then cloned into pCAGGS-MCS-AGIA, pCAGGS-MCS-S4D-AGIA, or pCAGGS-S4D-MCS-AGIA. Firefly luciferase (FLuc) was amplified by PCR using pGL4.32[luc2P/NF-kB-RE/Hygro] as a template and cloned into pCAGGS-MCS-AGIA or pCAGGS-MCS-S4D-AGIA using restriction enzymes. For the generation of KI cells, genomic DNA was isolated from HeLa cells, locus-specific 5′ and 3′ homology arms were amplified by PCR, and restriction enzyme sites were added. These homology arms and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences were designed to remove the stop codon from the gene ORF, and to attach sfGFP and the S4D tag. Then, these fragments were cloned into the LITMUS29 vector using the In-Fusion system (Takara Bio). The sgRNA vector (Addgene) was used to produce KI cells. The guide nucleotide sequences were as follows: 5′-AGTCAGATCAGCTCCTAAGG-3′ (RelA) and 5′-GCAAAGGGGCTGAAAGAACA- 3′ (IκBα). The target sequences were cloned into the sgRNA vectors using Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs). For cells stably expressing DRD1 or FLuc, pCSII-CMV-DRD1-S4D-AGIA, FLuc-AGIA, -FLuc-S4D-AGIA, or -FLuc-I3D-AGIA was constructed by using PCR and restriction enzyme. Lentivirus for expressing DRD1-S4D-AGIA, S4D-FLuc-AGIA, FLuc-S4D-AGIA, or FLuc-I3D-AGIA were produced in HEK293T cells by transfection of pCSII-CMV-DRD1 or -FLuc expression vector together with pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev and pCAG-HIVgp. Culture medium was exchanged after 24 h transfection, and the cells were cultured for 48 h. Then, the lentiviruses were concentrated by using Lenti-X concentrator (Takara Bio). HEK293T or HeLa cells supplemented with 5 µg/ml Polybrene (Nacalai Tesque) were infected by the appropriate lentivirus, and culture medium was exchanged after 24 h infection. 5 µg/ml blasticidin S (InvivoGen) selection was started after 24 h from exchange of culture medium. In vitro transcription and wheat cell-free protein synthesis were performed using the WEPRO1240 expression kit (Cell-Free Sciences). Transcription was performed using SP6 RNA polymerase with the plasmids or DNA fragments described above as templates. The translation reaction was performed in bilayer mode using the WEPRO1240 expression kit (Cell-Free Sciences), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For biotin labeling, cell-free synthesized crude biotin ligase (BirA) produced using the wheat cell-free expression system was added to the bottom layer, and 0.5 µM (final concentration) of d-biotin (Nacalai Tesque) was added to both the upper and lower layers, as described previously. IMiD at a final concentration of 50 µM and 0.5 µl biotinylated CRBN were mixed in 15 µl AlphaScreen buffer containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.01% Tween20, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mg/ml BSA. Then, 5 µl of a mixture containing 0.8 µl FLAG-GST-Venus-m1, -m2, or -m3 in AlphaScreen buffer was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 26 °C for 1 h in a 384-well AlphaPlate (PerkinElmer). Subsequently, 5 µl of a detection mixture containing 0.2 µg/ml anti-DYKDDDDK mouse mAb (Wako), 0.08 µl streptavidin-coated donor beads, and 0.08 µl Protein A-coated acceptor beads (PerkinElmer) in AlphaScreen buffer was added to each well. After incubation at 26 °C for 1 h, luminescence was read on an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer). To confirm IMiD-dependent degradation of Venus-tagged proteins, HEK293T-CRBN−/− cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with 400 ng pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-CRBN-WT together with 50 ng pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-Venus-m1, -m2, -m3, or -m2 variant (G416A).

After transfection for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, and permeabilization was performed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (for p53, STING, MAVS, and GM130) or 0.01% digitonin in PBS (for DRD1) at room temperature for 15 min. Then, the cells were incubated with 0.5% cattle serum (CS) in TBST at 4 °C for 1 h, and incubated with an anti-AGIA antibody (produced by our laboratory) at 4 °C for 16 h. After washing with TBST at room temperature for 15 min, the cells were incubated with an Alexa Flour 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The nucleus, ER, and mitochondria were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), ER-ID (Enzo), or Mito-ID (Enzo), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After washing with TBST at room temperature for 15 min, the stained cells were mounted with anti-fade (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) and observed under a BZ-X810 Microscope (Keyence). For immunofluorescence staining of GM130, the cells were incubated with an anti-AGIA antibody (for GM130-S4D-AGIA) together with an anti-GM130 antibody (for staining Golgi apparatus) (MBL, M179-3MS, 1:200) at 4 °C for 16 h.

HeLa cells were cultured in six-well plates for 24 h and we made RelA-sfGFP-S4D and IkBa-sfGFP-S4D-KI cells as described previously by using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio). After 2 days of transfection, the cells were passaged and cultured in 10 cm dishes. After 2 days of culture, the GFP-positive cells were isolated by sorting on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). The insertion of sfGFP-S4D into RelA or IκBα gene loci was confirmed by a band shift on immunoblot analysis. To examine the reversibility of the S4D system, KI (RelA-sfGFP-S4D or IκBα-sfGFP-S4D) HeLa cells were cultured in 12-well plates. The cells were treated with DMSO or 10 µM pomalidomide for 6 h, and then the DMSO or pomalidomide was removed by washing with culture medium. Cells were harvested at the times indicated in Fig. 4g and lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma–Aldrich). The protein concentrations of the lysates were quantitated by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the expression of RelA-sfGFP-S4D or IκBα-sfGFP-S4D was analyzed by immunoblot.

Parental or KI HeLa cells were cultured in 6-well or 12-well plates and pretreated with DMSO (0.1%) or pomalidomide in culture medium for the times indicated in each figure. Then, the cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for the indicated times and harvested using TrypLE (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The protein fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using specific antibodies. For combination treatment with TNF-α and cycloheximide (CHX), parental or KI (RelA-sfGFP-S4D) HeLa cells were cultured in 96-well plates and treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α and 10 µg/ml CHX for 24 h. For combination treatment with TNF-α and pomalidomide, parental or KI (RelA-sfGFP-S4D) HeLa cells were cultured in 96-well plates and pretreated with DMSO (0.1%) or pomalidomide in culture medium. After 12 h of pomalidomide treatment, the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 12 h. Then, the number of viable cells was measured using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega) and a SpecraMax M3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Parental or KI (RelA-sfGFP-S4D) HeLa cells were cultured in six-well plates and pretreated with pomalidomide at the concentrations indicated in each figure. After 12 h of pomalidomide pretreatment, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TNF-α for the times indicated in each figure. Then, the cells were harvested using TrypLE, and the number of dead cells was counted by trypan blue staining using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma–Aldrich), and protein concentrations were measured by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Then, the lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with specific antibodies. For experiments with zVAD-FMK, the cells were treated with DMSO (0.1%) or 10 µM zVAD-FMK for 2 h before stimulation with TNF-α. All data were analyzed from at least three technical repeats (n = 3–5) and were presented as the means ± standard deviation (SD). Significant changes were analyzed by one-way analysis of variants (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s tests using GraphPad Prism (version 8) software (GraphPad, Inc.). Western blots and immunofluorescence images were repeated more than three times with similar results.

This study was approved by the Mansoura Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board (MFM-IRB) Approval Number RP/15.06.62. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study and its results are in accordance with the Jena Declaration (https://www.uni-jena.de/unijenamedia/Universit%C3%A4t/Abteilung+Hochschulkommunikation/Presse/Jenaer+Erkl%C3%A4rung/Jenaer_Erklaerung_EN.pdf). Samples were acquired from 10 adult Egyptian individuals. These were recruited from healthy relatives escorting patients admitted to Mansoura University hospital. Those consented to join the study and who met the main selection criteria, i.e., they identified as Egyptians up to the third generation, were included. Medical history was taken to ascertain no history of chronic diseases, followed by a full clinical examination by a medical doctor alongside routine laboratory investigations (Liver and kidney function tests and complete blood count (CBC)). For nine individuals, high-coverage Illumina short-read data were generated. For the assembly individual, high-coverage short-read data were generated as well as high-coverage PacBio data and 10x Genomics data. Furthermore, we used public Illumina short-read data from 100 Egyptian individuals from Pagani et al.. See Supplementary Data 1 and 7 for an overview of the individuals and the corresponding raw and result data generated in this study. For PacBio library preparation, the SMRTbell DNA libraries were constructed following the manufacturer’s instructions (Pacific Bioscience, www.pacb.com). The SMRTbell DNA libraries were sequenced on the PacBio Sequel and generated 298.2 Gb of data. Sequencing data from five PacBio libraries were generated at overall 99x genome coverage. For 350 bp library construction, the genomic DNA was sheared, and fragments with sizes of ~350 bp were purified from agarose gels. The fragments were ligated to adaptors and amplified using PCR. The generated libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X Ten using PE150 and generated 312.8 Gb of data. For the assembly individual, sequencing data from five libraries were generated at overall 90x genome coverage. For nine additional individuals, one library each was generated, amounting to an overall 305x coverage of sequencing data. For the 100 individuals of Pagani et al., three were sequenced at high coverage (30×) and 97 at low coverage (8×). The average coverage over SNV positions for all 110 samples is provided in Supplementary Data 7. For RNA sequencing, ribosomal RNA was removed from total RNA, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized, and then adaptors were ligated. The second strand of cDNA was then degraded to generate a directional library. The generated libraries with insert sizes of 250–300 bp were selected and amplified and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq using PE150. Overall, 64,875,631 150 bp paired-end sequencing reads were generated. For 10x Genomics sequencing, the Chromium Controller was used for DNA indexing and barcoding according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics, www.10xgenomics.com). The generated fragments were sheared, and then adaptors were ligated. The generated libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X Ten using PE150 and generated 272.7 Gb of data. Sequencing data from four 10x libraries was generated at overall 80x genome coverage. We used WTDBG2 for human de novo assembly followed by its accompanying polishing tool WTPOA-CNS with PacBio reads and in a subsequent polishing run with Illumina short reads. This assembly was further polished using PILON with short-read data (cf. Supplementary Methods: WTDBG2-based assembly). An alternative assembly was generated by using FALCON, QUIVER, SSPACE-LONGREAD, PBJELLY, FRAGSCAFF, and PILON (cf. Supplementary Methods: FALCON-based assembly). Proceeding from the WTDBG2-based assembly, we constructed a meta-assembly. Regions larger than 800 kb that were not covered by this base assembly and were not located within centromere regions were extracted from the alternative FALCON-based assembly (Supplementary Data 3). See Supplementary Fig. 1 for an overview of our assembly strategy, including meta-assembly construction (cf. Supplementary Methods: Meta-assembly construction). Assembly quality and characteristics were assessed with QUAST-LG. In addition, we removed misassemblies in centromeres or in segmental duplication regions from the QUAST-LG report and furthermore removed SVs from misassemblies (cf. Supplementary Methods: Assembly comparison and QC). The extraction of coordinates for meta-assembly construction was performed using QUAST-LG output. K-mer multiplicity was assessed with KAT. Following Porubsky et al., we computed QV as (−10) times log10 of the number of homozygous variants divided by the effective genome size. Towards this, we mapped all short reads to the assembly using BWA MEM and perform variant calling using FREEBAYES with default parameters. We kept only homozygous variants with a minimum quality of 10 using VCFTOOLS. Single-nucleotide differences were counted as difference of 1 bp, indel differences as the length differences between reference and alternative allele. Based on SAMTOOLS command stats, we computed the sum of bases with short read coverage as effective genome size. Repeatmasking was performed by using REPEATMASKER with RepBase version 3.0 (Repeatmasker Edition 20181026) and Dfam_consensus (http://www.dfam-consensus.org) (cf. Supplementary Methods: Repeat annotation). We trimmed Illumina short sequencing reads of 110 Egyptian individuals using FASTP 0.20.0 with default parameters, mapped the output reads to GRCh38 and GATK bundle sequences using BWA 0.7.15-r1140 and sorted by chromosomal position using SAMTOOLS 1.3.1. Subsequently, we extracted reads that did not map to GRCh38 using SAMTOOLS with parameter F13 (i.e., read paired, read unmapped, mate unmapped) and repeated the mapping and sorting using the Egyptian de novo assembly. We merged the read-group specific BAM files for each sample and calculated the per base read depth using SAMTOOLS. Afterwards, we aggregated the results via custom scripts and extracted uniquely inserted sequences from the Egyptian de novo assembly. Insertions were defined as contiguous regions of at least 500 bp having a coverage of more than 5 reads per base in 10 or more samples. Lastly, we BLASTed the obtained sequences against the standard databases (option nt) for highly similar sequences (option megablast) using a custom script. For the uniquely inserted sequences that we identified, we created a pileup over all BAM files containing the reads that did not map to GRCh38 using SAMTOOLS. Based on these pileups, we then called the variants using BCFTOOLS. Variants with quality of more than 10 were kept. Phasing was performed for the assembly individual’s SNVs and short indels obtained from combined genotyping with the other Egyptian individuals, i.e., based on short-read data. These variants were phased using 10x Genomics data and the 10x Genomics LONGRANGER WGS pipeline with four 10x libraries provided for one combined phasing. See Supplementary Methods: Variant phasing for details. Calling of SNVs and small indels was performed with GATK 3.8 using the parameters of the best practice workflow. Reads in each read group were trimmed using Trimmomatic and subsequently mapped against reference genome hg38 using BWA-MEM version 0.7.17. Then, the alignments for all read groups were merged sample-wise and marked for duplicates. After the base recalibration, we performed variant calling using HaplotypeCaller to obtain GVCF files. These files were input into GenotypeGVCFs to perform joint genotyping. Finally, the variants in the outputted VCF file were recalibrated, and only those variants that were flagged as PASS were kept for further analyses. We used FastQC, Picard Tools and verifyBamId for QC (cf. Supplementary Methods: Small variant QC). Variant annotation was performed using ANNOVAR and VEP (cf. Supplementary Methods: Small variant annotation). SVs were called using DELLY2 with default parameters according to instructions on the DELLY2 website for germline SV calling (https://github.com/dellytools/delly) (cf. Supplementary Methods: Structural variant QC). Overlapping SV calls in the same individual were collapsed by the use of custom scripts. See Supplementary Methods: Collapsing SVs for details. For population-genetic analyses, we compared the Egyptian variant data with variant data from five additional sources specified in Supplementary Data 12. Individuals together with their annotations are listed in Supplementary Data 11. Variant data were merged to contain only variants present in all data sets and subsequently filtered and LD pruned. Genotype PCA was computed using SMARTPCA from the EIGENSOFT package. Admixture was computed with ADMIXTURE (cf. Supplementary Methods: Population genetics and Supplementary Methods: SNP array-based Egyptian variant data). ROH were computed on the same files that were used for PC computation and admixture using PLINK –homozyg. ROHs with size larger than 5 Mb were summed to obtain overall length of ROHs per individual. Haplogroup assignment was performed for 227 individuals using HAPLOGREP2. Furthermore, mitochondrial haplogroups were obtained from Pagani et al. for 100 individuals. See Supplementary Methods: Mitochondrial haplogroups for details. Our set of common Egyptian SNVs comprises variants with genotypes in a minimum of 100 individuals whose alternative allele has a frequency of more than 5%. Those common Egyptian SNVs that are otherwise rare, i.e., have an AF of <1% in the 1000 Genomes, and gnomAD populations as well as in TOPMed were considered Egyptian-specific. AFs were annotated using the Ensembl API. Furthermore, a list of Egyptian common variants without dbSNP rsID was compiled, see Supplementary Methods: Small variant annotation for details. RNA sequencing reads were mapped and quantified using STAR (Version 2.6.1.c). Haplotypic expression analysis was performed by using PHASER and PHASER GENE AE (version 1.1.1) with Ensembl version 95 annotation on the 10x-phased haplotypes using default parameters. See Supplementary Methods: Haplotypic expression for details. GWAS catalog associations for GWAS of European ancestry were split into trait-specific data sets using experimental factor ontology terms. For every trait, a locus was defined as an associated variant +/− 1 Mb, and only loci that were replicated were retained. For proxy computation, we used our Egyptian cohort (n = 110) and the European individuals of 1000 Genomes (n = 503). For details, see Supplementary Methods: Data integration with the GWAS catalog. We implemented a workflow to extract all Egyptref data for view in the IGV. This includes all sequencing data mapped to GRCh38 (cf. Supplementary Methods: Sequencing read mapping to GRCh38) as well as all assembly differences (cf. Supplementary Methods: Alignment to GRCh38 and Supplementary Methods: Assembly-based variant identification) and all Egyptian variant data. See Supplementary Methods: Gene-centric integrative data views for details. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
G. melas (12 individuals, standard length (SL) 90.7 ± 2.0 mm, body weight (BW) 17.7 ± 1.1 g) captured in the western Atlantic Ocean were purchased from Quality Marine (Los Angeles, CA). T. japonicus (4 individuals, SL 126.3 ± 3.8 mm, BW 37.0 ± 4.9 g) were caught in Tateyama Bay, Chiba, Japan. These two species were maintained in recirculating tanks with artificial SW (33‰, 837 ± 1.2 mOsmol kg−1; Tetra Marin Salt Pro, Spectrum Brands Japan) at 24 °C and fed with the polychaete worm Perinereis aibuhitensis until use. T. maculatus (26 individuals, SL 32.8 ± 2.1 mm, BW 1.3 ± 0.3 g) were purchased from Ishi-to-Izumi (Tokyo, Japan), and A. finis (13 individuals, SL 52.5 ± 3.9 mm, BW 2.0 ± 0.7 g) and H. mentalis (3 individuals, 129.7 ± 2.9 mm, BW 55.7 ± 6.6 g) were purchased from Ishi-to-Izumi or Kamihata Fish Industry (Hyogo, Japan). These three species were maintained in recirculating tanks with FW at 26 °C and fed with frozen blood worms (larvae of Chironomidae), live sludge worms (Tubifex tubifex), or medaka (Oryzias latipes). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained as described in a previous study. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology. Genomic DNA was extracted from the caudal fins of the four sole species using the Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). The partial fragments of the 16S rRNA gene were PCR amplified using primers designed based on the orthologues in Achiridae collected from the GenBank database to anneal to conserved regions (Supplementary Data 1, 2) with PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (Takara Bio). All PCR conditions in this research are summarised in Supplementary Data 3. The PCR products were purified with the FastGene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (Nippon Genetics) and cloned into the pGEM T-Easy Vector (Promega) after adding 3′ adenosine overhangs with TaKaRa Taq (Takara Bio). The cloned PCR fragments were extracted using the FastGene Plasmid Mini Kit (Nippon Genetics) and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and ABI PRISM 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting sequences were assembled using CLC Main Workbench ver 6.7.1 (QIAGEN) and aligned with the genes from Citharoides macrolepidotus (AP014588) and Lepidoblepharon ophthalmolepis (KJ433560), which belong to Citharidae, an ancestral family of Pleuronectiformes, using MAFFT v7.222 with the L-INS-i method. After trimming gaps automatically using trimAl, a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the alignment made up of 960 columns by the maximum likelihood method using PhyML ver 3.0 server with Smart Model Selection resulting in GTR + G + I, and the number of bootstrap replicates was set to 1000. The resulting tree was visualised in FigTree ver 1.4.3, available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/. The Sr profiles in sagittal otoliths were analysed by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) to obtain information on the environmental (salinity) history of the fishes. Otoliths were extracted from each individual, cleaned, dried, and embedded in UV-cured resin (Tama-koubou, Kanagawa, Japan). Each otolith was then ground transversally from the postrostrum side using a series of 120–4000 grid abrasive paper on a grinder/polisher (Doctor-Lap ML-182, Maruto Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain a transversal section showing all preformed layers including the core region formed at birth. After course grinding, otoliths were further polished to a mirror-finish with 1 µm diamond paste on a polisher (Labopol-4, Struers), cleaned and rinsed with deionised water prior and dried. For EPMA, specimens were platinum/palladium-coated with an ion-sputter (E-1030, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation) and analysed with an electron probe microanalyser (JXA-8230, JEOL) using Sr titanate (SrTiO3) as a reference standard. Maps of Sr concentration were generated with a focused beam set to 15 kV of accelerating voltage and 500 nA of beam current, with a pixel size of 2 µm and a dwell time of 40 ms. Total RNA was isolated from the brains and livers using ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene). After trace genomic DNA was eliminated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega), the first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised using Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (GE Healthcare) with the oligo (dT) primer (Supplementary Data 2) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The first fragment amplifications of fads2- and elovl5-like cDNA from H. mentalis and T. maculatus were carried out using the degenerate primers shown in Supplementary Data 2, which were designed based on highly conserved regions of fads2 and elovl5 orthologues from several species of Pleuronectiformes (Supplementary Data 1, 2) with TaKaRa Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio). To amplify the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA, the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) of both fads2 and elovl5-like cDNA from the two species was performed using the GeneRacer Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the DNA polymerases, PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase and Tks Gflex DNA polymerase (Takara Bio). The gene-specific primers for 5′ and 3′ RACE are shown in Supplementary Data 2. The purification, subcloning and sequencing of each PCR product was performed as described above without an A-tailing reaction. The resultant sequences were assembled to produce the full open reading frame (ORF) using CLC Main Workbench ver 6.7.1 (QIAGEN). The cDNA, including full ORFs, was PCR amplified using gene-specific primers that were annealed to the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) with PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase. The fads2- and elovl5-like cDNAs from G. melas and A. finis were isolated using primers designed to anneal to the conserved regions in the 5′ or 3′ UTR of the two genes from the above two species (Supplementary Data 2). The alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of fads2- and elovl5-like cDNA, with several orthologues from the GenBank database, was conducted by MAFFT ver 7.222 with the L-INS-i method. After trimming gaps automatically using trimAl, a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the alignment made up of 445 columns by the maximum likelihood method using the PhyML ver 3.0 server with Smart Model Selection, resulting in LG + G + I, and the number of bootstrap replicates was set to 1000. The resulting tree was visualised in FigTree and rooted with Chondrichthyes Fads1 sequences. The cDNAs corresponding to the fads2 and elovl5 ORFs of the four sole species and fads2 and elovl2 of zebrafish were PCR amplified using primers containing restriction enzyme sites of HindIII and XbaI for fads2 and elovl5 or HindIII and KpnI for elovl2 with PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (Supplementary Data 2). After gel purification following the method described above, the PCR products were then digested by the corresponding restriction enzymes (HindIII, XbaI, and KpnI; Takara Bio) and cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) digested by HindIII and XbaI for fads2 and elovl5 or pAUR123 (Takara Bio) digested by HindIII and KpnI for elovl2. The mutations in fads2a and fads2b of H. mentalis in pYES2 were introduced by inverse PCR using the PrimeSTAR Mutagenesis Basal Kit (Takara Bio) and primers carrying each substitution shown in Supplementary Data 2. Transformation with pYES2 vectors and the culture condition of INVSc1 yeast (S. cerevisiae) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were described in a previous study. The following fatty acids (Larodan Fine Chemicals) were used as substrates: 18:3n − 3, 20:4n − 3 and 22:5n − 3 for the yeast transformed with fads2 and 18:4n − 3, 20:5n − 3 and 22:5n − 3 for elovl5. After 48 h of culture at 30 °C in the presence of each substrate fatty acid, the yeast cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold HBSS and lyophilised using a freeze dryer (FDU-1200, Tokyo Rikakikai). FAMEs were prepared from the pellets of yeast and analysed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2025, Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionisation detector and a silica capillary column (L × I.D. 30 m × 0.32 mm, df 0.25 μm; SUPELCOWAX 10, Merck) as previously described. Enzymatic activities were calculated as the proportion of fatty acid substrate converted to desaturated or elongated products with the following formula: [product area/(product area + substrate area)] × 100 (%). To analyse the Δ6 activity towards 24:5n − 3, we constructed co-expression vectors of Achiridae Fads2 and zebrafish Elovl2 using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio). Isolation of the elovl2 with PADH1 and TADH1 regions from the above pAUR123 vector as an insert and linearisation of the pYES2 vectors carrying each fads2 were carried out by the primers designed as described in the manual and PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase. The recombinant yeast transformed by the resultant vectors were selected and cultured with 22:5n − 3 as described above for 24 h, but without induction of the fads2 connected to PGAL1 by galactose, to allow the elongation of 22:5n − 3 to 24:5n − 3 by the elovl2 connected to PADH1, which is constitutively expressed. Then, 2% galactose was added to the yeast cultures for the induction of fads2 to allow the desaturation of 24:5n − 3 to 24:6n − 3, and the cultures were further incubated for 48 h until collection. To standardise and compare the Δ6 activity towards 24:5n − 3 in Achiridae Fads2, the yeast were cultured in the presence of 18:3n − 3 as control according to the above process. The Δ6 activity towards 24:5n − 3 was calculated as described above, considering the areas of 24:5n − 3 produced by Elovl2 as the substrate, then divided by the Δ6 activity in the control cultures for standardisation. Two primer pairs were designed that anneal as described in Fig. 4a, but do not extend across the putative exon–intron junctions predicted from the genomic fads2 structure of Cynoglossus semilaevis (Gene ID: 103380276). Genomic DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using combinations of primers (Supplementary Data 2) with TaKaRa LA Taq and PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase. The products of TaKaRa LA Taq were used to determine the draft sequences. The resultant sequences were combined and annotated according to the CDS and UTR based on the cDNA sequences and those of C. semilaevis. The capacity for endogenous PUFA biosynthesis in each species was examined using radiolabelled fatty acid substrates. Brain and hepatic cells were collected from G. melas, T. maculatus, A. finis, and H. mentalis. The fishes were anaesthetised with 0.02% (v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol, and their bulbus arteriosus was incised to remove the blood with 10 U/ml heparin sodium in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) to prevent the contamination of red blood cells following culture. The isolated livers were minced and incubated with 2 mg/ml collagenase IV (C5138, Sigma) and 150 U/ml DNase I (D5025, Sigma) in HBSS for 4 h at 20 °C. After incubation, the resultant hepatic cell suspensions were filtered and rinsed as described in a previous study. The isolated brains were minced and filtered as described in a previous study. For the LC-PUFA biosynthesis assays, all cell pellets were resuspended in L-15 medium (Invitrogen) containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin sodium (Wako), 50 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Wako) and 50 U/ml benzylpenicillin potassium (Wako). For brain cultures, foetal bovine serum (Gibco) was added to the medium at a 10% concentration. The 2 ml cell suspensions were dispensed into six-well plates (T. maculatus: 1.2 × 107 hepatic and 7.0 × 106 brain cells, A. finis: 1.2 × 107 and 6.2 × 105 cells), or 5 ml was dispensed into 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks (G. melas: 2.1 × 107 and 1.8 × 107 cells, H. mentalis: 2.1 × 107 and 1.8 × 107 cells). The radiolabelled [1-14C] 18:3n − 3 or [1-14C] 22:5n − 3 (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) was conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid free, A8806, Sigma) as described in a previous study. The cells were cultured with 3.7 kBq (2 nmol)/ml of the PUFA/BSA complexes at 20 °C for 40 h. The cells were then harvested and centrifuged at 400 × g for 2 min to discard the supernatant and rinsed with 5 ml of HBSS containing 1% BSA. Total lipids were extracted from the cell pellets using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) as described in previous studies. FAMEs were prepared from evaporated total lipids using a Fatty Acid Methylation Kit (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and purified using a FAME Purification Kit (Nacalai Tesque) following the manufacturer’s instructions. FAMEs were concentrated in 1 ml of hexane, and 400 µl was applied as 1 cm streaks to TCL (20 cm × 20 cm; Merck) plates, which were pre-immersed in 0.1 mg/ml silver nitrate in acetonitrile for 10 min and activated at 110 °C for 30 min. The plates were developed in toluene/acetonitrile (95:5, v/v) and subjected to autoradiography using imaging plates with an image analyser (FLA-9000, Fujifilm). The radiolabelled [1-14C] fatty acids for the standard mixture were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (18:3n − 3, 20:3n − 3, 20:5n − 3 and 22:5n − 3) or Moravek (22:5n − 3 and 22:6n − 3). These were mixed to 370 Bq each and methyl-esterified as described above to create 1 ml of standard solution (except 20:4n − 3) in hexane. The other standards for intermediate metabolites in the DHA biosynthetic pathway, 20:4n − 3 and 24:6n − 3, were biosynthesised from 18:4n − 3 and 24:5n − 3 (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) by the yeast transformed with pYES2 carrying elovl5 from Nibea mitsukurii and fads2 from D. rerio, respectively, following the above method. The yeast were cultured with 3.7 kBq of the fatty acids and lysed by incubation with 50 µl of 30 mg/ml zymolyase (Nacalai Tesuque, Inc.) at 37 °C for 30 min. The total lipids of these lysates were extracted, methylated, and purified as described above to create 1 ml of metabolite solutions in hexane. The final standard mixture was prepared by mixing 100 µl each of the standard solutions (except 20:4n − 3) and the metabolite solution of 18:4n − 3. The positions where 24:5n − 3 and 24:6n − 3 appeared on the TLC plates were confirmed using the metabolite solution of 24:5n − 3 (Supplementary Fig. 8). To examine survival of G. melas, T. maculatus, and T. japonicus in hypoosomotic condition, individuals of these species were exposed to hypoosmolality by discarding half a tank of water and refilling the tank gradually with FW or diluted SW using syphon effect for around 12 h according to the following schedule over 12 days: 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% SW for 2 days each. After acclimation to 10% SW, the tank water was further diluted to 5% and 2.5% for 1 day each. The otolith data are representative of six, four and six individuals of G. melas, A. finis and H. mentalis, respectively. The bootstrap values are shown next to each branch point of the phylogenetic trees. The Fads2 and Elovl5 enzymes were functionally characterised by using coding sequence of the enzyme gene isolated from single individual of each species as representative. The PCR amplifications of genomic fads2 were performed with template genomic DNA purified from three individuals of H. mentalis and all of them showed identical amplification patterns.

A knockout mouse strain in which the Gdpd3 (NM_024228) gene was disrupted was generated by Setsurotech Inc. (Tokushima, Japan) using a genome-editing technique. In brief, in vitro fertilised zygotes (C57BL/6 x C57BL/6) were electroporated with 100 ng µl−1 recombinant Cas9 protein (Alt-R® S. p. Cas9 Nuclease, 1074181, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA, USA), 100 ng µl−1 crRNA (Alt-R® CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA, Integrated DNA Technologies), and 100 ng µl−1 tracrRNA (Alt-R® CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA, Integrated DNA Technologies). The target sequence of Gdpd3 crRNA was (5′-GGCAGAACAAAGTACAGGAG-AGG-3′) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Electroporated zygotes were transferred into the oviduct of pseudopregnant female mice, and the mutant progeny were born on E19. Genotyping was carried out by hot-start PCR of genomic DNA from mouse tails. Two primer sets were used: Gdpd3 FWS3 5′-AGGCTATGATCCCTCTCCTGTACT-3′ and Gdpd3 R2 5′-CCTCTAGGCCCCAAGACTCT-3′ to detect the WT Gdpd3 allele, and Gdpd3 FB1 5′-GCTATGATCCCTCTCCTTTGTTCT-3′ and Gdpd3 R2 to detect the mutant (Δ5 bp) Gdpd3 allele. For PCR analysis, genomic DNA was subjected to 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 64 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C to amplify the 298 bp product from the Gdpd3 WT allele, and was subjected to 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 68 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C to amplify the 293 bp product from the Gdpd3 mutant allele (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Takara ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) was used for PCR. The Lgr4/Gpr48 gene-trap mouse strain was established as described (B6;CB-Lgr4, ID 1244, stocked at CARD, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). The Lgr4/Gpr48 gene-trap mice were backcrossed for fourth generations in the C57BL/6 background. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Crea Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). To use a well-described tet-CML mouse model, SCL-tTA transgenic mice (JAX database strain #006209) and TRE-BCR-ABL1 transgenic mice (JAX database strain #006202) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. SCL-tTA (C57BL/6; F5) and TRE-BCR-ABL1 (C57BL/6; F5) transgenic mice were interbred to generate SCL-tTA x TRE-BCR-ABL1 double transgenic mice as described. These animals were maintained in cages supplied with drinking water containing 20 mg L−1 doxycycline (Dox; Sigma-Aldrich). At 5 weeks after birth, expression of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene was induced by replacing the Dox-containing drinking water with normal drinking water. The CML-like disease developed in the double transgenic mutants about 5 weeks after Dox withdrawal. These animals were designated as tet-CML-affected mice in this study. To establish our Gdpd3−/− tet-CML-affected mouse model and our Lgr4/Gpr48 tet-CML mouse model, we crossed Gdpd3−/− mice (C57BL/6), or heterozygous Lgr4/Gpr48 mice (C57BL/6; F4), with SCL-tTA x TRE-BCR-ABL1 double transgenic mice, respectively. To establish our BCR-ABL1 transduction/transplantation-based CML model (retro-CML-affected mice), normal haematopoietic stem/progenitor (LSK) cells (4–5 × 103 cells per recipient mouse) isolated from WT (C57BL/6; CREA Japan, Inc.), Gdpd3−/−, or Lgr4/Gpr48 mice were transduced with the human BCR-ABL1-ires EGFP retrovirus and transplanted into irradiated (9.5 Gy, Gammacell® 40 Exactor, Best Theratronics Ltd., Ottawa, Canada) recipient C57BL/6 mice along with BMMNCs (5 × 105 cells per recipient mouse) isolated from non-irradiated C57BL/6 mice. The CML-like disease developed in these recipients by 12–20 days post-transplantation. To examine the in vivo effects of dasatinib administration, retro-CML-affected mice received vehicle alone [artificial gastric fluid solution (993 ml ddH2O containing 2.0 g NaCl, 7 ml conc. HCl, and 3.2 g pepsin)], or dasatinib (Sprycel®; 5 mg kg−1 day−1; Bristol-Myers Squibb) in the vehicle. Treatment was delivered by oral gavage on days 8–60 post-transplantation. All animal care and experimentation were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal and recombinant DNA experiments of Hiroshima University (Authorized Protocol Numbers A18-36, A18-37 and 30-257). BMMNCs were isolated from the two hind limbs of tet-CML-affected mice (SCL-tTA
TRE-BCR-ABL1) and WT healthy littermate mice (SCL-tTA+) at 5 weeks after Dox withdrawal.

WT LSK cells were purified using a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). For serial transplantation of CML-LSK cells (see below), MNCs isolated from the two hind limbs and spleen of retro-CML-affected mice were first blocked by incubation with anti-FcγIII/II receptor mAb (dilution 1:200, Clone # 2.4G2, Cat. # BD 553142, Lot # 79813, BD Biosciences), and then stained with anti-CD4-biotin (dilution 1:200, Clone # RM4-5, Cat. # 13-0042-86, Lot #E02364-369, eBioscience), anti-CD8a-biotin (dilution 1:200, Clone # 53-6.7, Cat. # 13-0081-86, Lot #E02387-339, eBioscience), anti-B220-biotin (dilution 1:200, Clone # RA3-6B2, Cat. # 13-0452-86, Lot #E02532-301, eBioscience), anti-Mac1-biotin (dilution 1:200, Clone # M1/70, Cat. #13-0112-86, Lot #E033770, eBioscience), anti-Gr-1-biotin (dilution 1:200, Clone # RB6-8C5, Cat. #13-5931-86, Lot # E033865, eBioscience), anti-TER119-biotin (dilution 1:200, Clone # Ly-76, Cat. #13-5921-85, Lot # 4300555, eBioscience), anti-Sca-1-PE (dilution 1:200, Clone # E13-161.7, Cat. # BD553336, Lot # 05152, BD Biosciences), and anti-cKit-APC (dilution 1:200, Clone # ACK2, Cat. # 17-1172-83, Lot # E17176-101, eBioscience) mAbs. Biotinylated primary mAbs were visualised using Streptavidin-PE-Cy7 (dilution 1:400, Cat. # 557598, Lot # 6112577, BD Biosciences). BCR-ABL1/EGFP+ CML-LSK cells were purified using a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). For siRNA transductions (see below), CML-LSK cells were purified from BMMNCs of tet-CML-affected mice using a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). To evaluate the retention of disease-initiating capacity by CML-initiating cells in vivo, secondary transplantation of BCR-ABL1/EGFP+ CML-LSK cells was performed. BCR-ABL1/EGFP+ CML-LSK cells (3 × 104) freshly purified from primary BMT recipients were serially transplanted into a second set of lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy) congenic recipient mice along with 5 × 105 WT BMMNCs from C57BL/6 mice. Mouse survival and disease relapse were monitored for up to 90 days. MNCs isolated from PB of Gdpd3+/+ retro-CML-affected mice, Gdpd3−/− retro-CML-affected mice as well as from a normal healthy C57BL/6 mouse (negative control), were stained with anti-CD4-PE-Cy7 (dilution 1:500, Clone # RM4-5, Cat. # 25-0042-82, Lot #E07503-1630, eBioscience), anti-CD8a-PE-Cy7 (dilution 1:500, Clone # 53-6.7, Cat. # 25-0081-82, Lot # E07510-1631, eBioscience), anti-B220-PE (dilution 1:500, Clone # RA3-6B2, Cat. # 553089, Lot # 76923, BD Biosciences), anti-Mac1-APC (dilution 1:500, Clone # M1/70, Cat. # 17-0112-82, Lot #E07073-1631, eBioscience), and anti-Gr-1-APC (dilution 1:500, Clone # RB6-8C5, Cat. # 17-5931-82, Lot # E07334-1630, eBioscience) mAbs.

BCR-ABL1/EGFP+ cells in PB isolated from a Gdpd3+/+, Gdpd3−/−, Lgr4+/+, and Lgr4Gt/Gt retro-CML-affected mouse were evaluated using a FACS Aria III instrument. The absolute number of CML-LSK cells in the spleen and BM of a retro-CML-affected mouse was calculated as [total number of MNCs isolated from either the BM of the two hind limbs or the spleen × frequency of BCR-ABL1/EGFP+ CML-LSK cells (%) × 1/100]. The absolute number of LT-CML stem cells in BM of a tet-CML mouse was calculated as [total number of MNCs isolated from BM of two hind limbs × frequency of CD150+CD48−CD135−LSK cells (%) × 1/100]. For analysis of blood cell counts. PB from the postorbital vein was analysed by a particle counter PCE-310 (ERMA Inc., Tokyo Japan). For lipidomics analyses, total BMMNCs (1 × 107) were isolated from Gdpd3+/+ tet-CML-affected mice (five females), Gdpd3−/− tet-CML-affected mice (one male and three females) at 5-week post-Dox withdrawal as described above. Total BMMNCs (1 × 107) were also isolated from 6–8-wk old WT C57BL/6 mice (two males and four females). CML-LSK cells (5 × 105) were isolated from Gdpd3+/+ tet-CML-affected mice (four males and 11 females), or from Gdpd3−/− tet-CML-affected mice (six males and ten females), at 5 weeks post-Dox withdrawal as described above. Cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C immediately after centrifugation. Lipidomics analyses were performed by Shimadzu Techno-research Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). LPAs were measured using a NexeraX2 system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and Triple Quad 5500 (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) (Source Data file, Supplementary Method 1). Lipid mediators were measured using a NexeraX2 System and an LCMS-8050 liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer system (Shimadzu) (Source Data file, Supplementary Method 2, 3). Data were compiled using the Lipidomediator LC/MS/MS Method Package (Ver. 3) (Shimadzu Corporation). Lipidomics data analyses were performed using Traverse MS Ver. 1.2.7. (Reifycs Inc., Tokyo, Japan). LT CML stem cells isolated from Gdpd3+/+ tet-CML-affected mice and Gdpd3−/− tet-CML-affected mice were directly sorted into 500 μl Isogene solution (Nippon Gene, Co. Ltd., Toyama, Japan). RNA extraction and sequencing were performed by DNAFORM (Yokohama, Japan). The RNA quality was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). All RNA samples had an RNA integrity number of >7.5 and exceeded the quality threshold for RNA sequencing. Libraries were constructed from total RNA using the SMART-Seq® v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Clontech, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan). Full-length double-stranded cDNA libraries were fragmented by transposase using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end reads of 150 bases were generated using HiSeq X Ten (Illumina). Sequence reads in Fastq format were assessed for quality using FastQC. Filtered reads were mapped to the reference genome related to the species using STAR v.2.6.1a alignment software. Gene expression levels were measured with the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (ver. 1.20.0) (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DES0eq2.html) using the Ensembl database (https://ensembl.org/index.html) and quantified as the ratio of reads mapped to a gene to the gene length in kbp and expressed as the fragments per kb of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The Bioconductor package DESeq2 (ver. 1.20.0) was also used for calculating BaseMean, FoldChange, P-value (two-tailed Wald test), and adjusted P-value (Padj, two-tailed Wald test). MA-plots were created using the Bokeh library (ver. 0.13.0) (https://docs.bokeh.org/en/0.13.0/). GO enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resource 6.8. (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). The RNA-sequencing data of Gdpd3 and Gdpd3−LT-CML stem cells are available from a public database GEO (GEO, ID: GSE149442) in NCBI, NIH, USA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/). The RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands) was used to purify RNA samples from LT-stem cells (4–5 × 104) isolated from six Gdpd3 tet-CML-affected (SCL-tTATRE-BCR-ABL1) mice and eight healthy littermate control (SCL-tTA) mice at 5 weeks post-Dox withdrawal. RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Takara-Clontech). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green Premix EX Taq (Takara) on an Mx3000P® Real-time PCR system (Stratagene). The following primers were used: 5′-CAT TTC GCT GTG GAT GGA TGA-3′, and 5′-CCA TTG GCT CCC AAG CTG A-3′′ for Gdpd3; 5′-AGG TCA TCA CTA TTG GCA ACG A-3′ and 5′-CAC TTC ATG ATG GAA TTG AAT GTA GTT-3′ for Actb (β-actin). The following cycle parameters were used: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, and annealing and elongation at 60 °C for 30 s for Gdpd3, and 57 °C for 30 s for Actb. OP-9 murine stromal cells were purchased from ATCC® (Lot # 70019055, CRL-2749). LT-CML stem cells (1 × 103 per plate) were co-cultured on OP-9 stromal cells in 3% O2 at 37 °C for 5 days. Cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and plated in semi-solid methylcellulose medium containing SCF, IL-3, IL-6 and erythropoietin (Methocult GF M3434; Stem Cell Technologies). WT haematopoietic stem/progenitor (LSK) cells were cultured in semi-solid methylcellulose medium (Methocult GF M3434). After growth for 7 days under hypoxic (3% O2) conditions at 37 °C, colony numbers were counted under a light microscope. C57BL/6-CD45.1 mouse strain was purchased from Sankyo Labo Service Corporation, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Lethally irradiated C57BL/6-CD45.1 congenic recipient mice were transplanted with 2 × 103 normal haematopoietic LSK cells isolated from normal healthy Gdpd3+/+ or Gdpd3−/− mice (C57BL/6-CD45.2) plus 5×105 unfractionated BMMNCs from healthy C57BL/6-CD45.1 mice. Reconstitution of donor-derived cells (CD45.2) was monitored by staining blood cells with mAbs against FITC-CD45.2 (dilution 1:200, Clone # 104, Cat. # 11-0454-85, Lot # E00316-130, eBioscience), and PE-CD45.1 (dilution 1:200, Clone # A20, Cat. # BD553776, Lot # 17194, BD Biosciences) using a FACS Aria III instrument. For serial transplantation analyses, 2 × 103 normal LSK cells were obtained from recipient mice at 16 weeks post-transplantation (first-BMT) and transplanted into a second set of lethally irradiated C57BL/6-CD45.1 congenic mice (second-BMT) using the same BMT protocol. Data on GDPD3 mRNA levels in human CML patients were obtained from a public database GEO (GEO, ID: GSE12211) that contains microarray analyses of the CD34+ cells in PB from six CML patients before treatment, and the same six CML patients after 7 days of treatment with IM (400 mg kg−1 day−1). The following Cy3-labelled siRNA duplexes targetting Gdpd3 mRNA were synthesised by Dharmacon Inc.

Transfected cells were cultured in serum-free stem cell medium SF-03 containing BSA, TPO (100 ng ml−1), SCF (100 ng ml−1), and penicillin/streptomycin for 2 days under hypoxic (3% O2) conditions. Cy3-negative (control) and Cy3-positive cells were sorted using a FACS Aria III instrument. To determine colony-forming capacity, Cy3-negative and Cy3-positive CML-LSK cells were cultured in semi-solid methylcellulose medium (Methocult GF M3434; Stem Cell Technologies). Colonies were counted 7 days later as above. The following FITC-labelled siRNA duplexes targetting human GDPD3 mRNA were synthesised by Dharmacon Inc.: 5′-FITC- AGG AGA AGC UGG AGG UUU AUU-3′ and 5′-UAA ACC UCC AGC UUC UCC UUU-3′ for human GDPD3 #1; 5′-FITC-CCA UGA GCG UAG AGA UCA AUU-3′ and 5′-UUG AUC UCU ACG CUC AUG GUU-3′ for human GDPD3 siRNA #2. Viable BMMNCs from a chronic phase CML patient were obtained at the University Hospital, Dokkyo Medical University (IRB approval number: 26058). Primary CML cells were stained with mouse anti-CD34-APC mAb (dilution 1:100, Clone # 8G12, Cat. # 340441, Lot # 6183704, BD Biosciences) and sorted using a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). CD34+ CML cells were transfected for 3 h under hypoxic (3% O2) conditions with FITC-labelled siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in serum-free medium OPTI-MEM®I (Gibco) that lacked cytokines and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfected cells were cultured in serum-free stem cell medium SF-03 containing BSA, TPO (100 ng ml−1), SCF (100 ng ml−1), and penicillin/streptomycin for 3 days under hypoxic (3% O2) conditions. FITC-negative (control) and FITC-positive cells were sorted using a FACS Aria III instrument. K562 CML cells were purchased from ATCC® (Lot # 70016362, CCL-243) and transfected with FITC-labelled siRNA duplexes as above. The colony-forming abilities of transfected primitive human CML CD34+ cells and K562 cells were evaluated by culture in semi-solid methylcellulose medium containing SCF, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, G-CSF and erythropoietin (Methocult GF+ H4435; Stem Cell Technologies). After growth for 14 days at 37 °C under hypoxic (3% O2) conditions without or with 1 μm imatinib (Axon Medchem, Groningen, Netherlands), colony numbers were counted under a light microscope. To determine the cell cycle status of CML-LSK cells in vivo, retro-CML-affected mice were intraperitoneally administered BrdU (100 mg kg−1 of body weight in saline; Sigma) for 3 h. CML-LSK cells were recovered as described above and stained with mouse anti-BrdU-FITC mAb (dilution 1:500, Clone # 3D4, Cat. # 51-23614 L, Lot # 7222635, BD Biosciences) plus 7AAD (BD Biosciences) by the standard procedure of FITC BrdU Flow Kit (559619, BD PharmingenTM). The cell cycle distribution of CML-LSK cells was determined using a FACS Aria III instrument. For immunostaining, LT-CML stem cells that were freshly isolated from tet-CML-affected mice were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for one hour. Fixed cells were permeabilised with 0.25% Triton-X100 for 15 min, washed, and blocked by incubation in 2% BSA in TBS for one hour. Blocked cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (dilution 1:50, Clone # D9E, Cat. # 4060S, Lot# 5, Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236) (dilution 1:50, Clone # D57.2.2E, Cat. # 4858S, Lot# 11, Cell Signalling Technology), rabbit anti-Foxo3a (dilution 1:25, Clone 75D8, Cat. #2497S, Lot # 2, Cell Signalling Technology) and mouse (dilution 1:50, Clone # B56, Cat. # 550609, Lot# 43365, BD Pharmingen) mAbs. Primary mAbs were visualised by incubating the cells with AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:200, Cat. # A11030, Lot # 833292, Molecular Probes®, Life technologies, Eugene, OR, USA), or AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:200, Cat. # A21245, Lot # 927083, Molecular Probes®) antibodies (Abs). Nuclei were stained with the DNA marker DAPI (Sigma). Stained slides were mounted using Prolong Diamond® (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and fluorescent images were acquired using confocal microscopy (FV10i, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Photoshop software (CS4 Ver11.0.2. Adobe). To examine interactions between Foxo3a and active β-catenin, we used the Duolink® in situ PLA system (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). LT-CML stem cells that were freshly isolated from tet-CML-affected mice were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 60 min. For PGE2 treatment, LT-CML stem cells were incubated in 3% O2 at 37 °C for 2 h with the appropriate vehicle control or 10 μM PGE2 (Item: 14010, Batch:0533515-113, Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Treated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 60 min. Fixed cells were permeabilised with 0.25% Triton-X100 for 15 min, washed, and blocked by incubation in 2% BSA in TBS for one hour. Blocked cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-Foxo3a (dilution 1:25, Clone 75D8, Cat. #2497S, Lot # 2, Cell Signalling Technology) and mouse anti-active β-catenin (dilution 1:25, Clone 8E7, Cat. # 05-665, Lot #, 2700799 and 3270747, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) mAbs. The proximate binding of these Abs was then detected using PLA secondary Abs. Stained slides were mounted using Duolink® in situ Mounting Medium with DAPI (Merck), and fluorescent images were acquired by confocal microscopy (FV10i, Olympus) and Photoshop software (CS4 Ver11.0.2. Adobe). For RNA-sequencing in Fig. 7a and Supplementary Figs. 11a–c, FPKM, BaseMean, FoldChange, P-value (two-tailed Wald test), and adjusted P-value (two-tailed Wald test) were determined by the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (ver. 1.20.0) (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DES0eq2.html). For the Kaplan-Meier analyses for the survival of CML-affected mice in Figs. 1g, 2a, b, 6a, 7e, statistical differences were determined using the log-rank non-parametric test (IBM SPSS Statics 23, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). For Fig. 3a, b, 4a–c, the unpaired one-sided Student’s t test was used (Microsoft® Excel Ver. 16.40, Redmond, WA, USA). For the other comparisons, the unpaired two-sided Student’s t test was used (Microsoft® Excel Ver. 16.40). Data were indicated as the means ± standard deviation (s.d.). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The lipidomics analyses and RNA-sequencing were based on every single experiment. For Figs. 1d, 2a, 6a, 7e, these experiments were from two independent experiments. The other experiments were repeated at least three times. No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size. The sample size was determined on the basis of literature in this research field. During the reviewing process, a paper demonstrating that Lgr4 is essential for self-renewal in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) stem cells was published. The study supports our conclusion about the role of Lgr4 in maintenance of CML stem cells. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
Seeds of the CQ127 variety of quinoa were obtained from the USDA (Supplementary Table 7). Seeds of Chenopodium spp. were obtained from the USDA and the Institute of Plant Science and Resources at Okayama University (Supplementary Table 7). Seeds of the Arabidopsis
ttg1–21 (CS2105595) mutant on the Columbia (Col) background were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Quinoa seeds were sown in cell trays and grown at 23 °C under a neutral photoperiod (12-h light/12-h dark) in a phytotron. After 3 weeks, the seedlings were transplanted into standard potting mix (Ikubyou Baido, Takii, Kyoto, Japan) in 5 L plant pots and grown in a glasshouse. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 23 °C under long-day conditions (16-h light/8-h dark). EMS mutagenesis was conducted by Inplanta Innovations (Yokohama, Japan); we obtained approximately 8000 mutagenized seeds (M1 seeds) of the CQ127 variety. The mutagen-treated seeds were sown to produce M1 progeny, which were propagated to obtain the M3 generation. The M3 progeny were then screened for mutants related to EBC formation. EBCs were examined using an Axiovert 200 optical microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and images were captured using the Axiovision 4.6 software (Zeiss). To enumerate EBCs, the abaxial sides of leaves from 2-week-old quinoa plants were photographed under a microscope. EBCs were counted using image data, and the number of EBCs per leaf was calculated. Chlorophyll autofluorescence in EBCs was examined using an LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Zeiss). Images were captured and analyzed using LSM Image Examiner (Zeiss). Leaves were cut into sections (1.0–1.5 mm × 3 mm) using a razor blade immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), and fixed for 18 h at 4 °C. The samples were then fixed with 1% OsO4 in the same buffer for 12 h at 4 °C, rinsed in the same buffer for 10 min, dehydrated in ethanol, transferred to QY-1, and embedded in a Quetol 651 resin mixture (Nissin EM, Tokyo, Japan). Transverse sections (0.5-μm thickness) for light microscopy were obtained using an ultramicrotome (EM UC6; Leica, Vienna, Austria). Sections were dry-mounted on glass slides and stained with 1% (w/v) toluidine blue in 1% (w/v) sodium borate solution for 2–3 min at 90 °C. The sections were then examined by light microscopy, and areas of interest were selected for electron microscopy. Thin sections were cut using a diamond knife, collected on 200 × 75 mesh Formvar-coated grids, and stained with saturated uranyl acetate and lead citrate in 50% ethanol for 10 min. Specimens were viewed using an H-7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Leaves were cut into sections (2 mm × 4 mm) using a razor blade and subjected to osmium maceration as reported in a previous study. The specimens were initially fixed at 20 °C for 2 h in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) solution buffered at pH 7.2 with 0.05 M cacodylate. After rinsing with buffer solution, the specimens were successively immersed in 5%, 30%, and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions for 30 min per treatment. Specimens in 50% DMSO were frozen on an aluminum plate chilled with liquid nitrogen and split using a razor blade and hammer in a freeze-fracture apparatus (TF-1, EIKO Engineering, Tokyo, Japan). The split pieces were immediately placed in 50% DMSO solution at room temperature and thawed. The samples were then repeatedly rinsed in buffer (0.05 M cacodylate; pH 7.2) until the DMSO was completely removed, and then transferred to 0.1% OsO4 buffered at pH 7.2 with 0.05 M cacodylate. The specimens were incubated at 20 °C for 9 days, and the OsO4 solution was changed daily. Following the 9-day incubation period, the specimens were again fixed in 1% OsO4 for 1 h. The specimens were then rinsed with buffer solution and treated with 2% tannic acid for 1 h. The specimens were rinsed with distilled water, placed in 1% OsO4 for 1 h to increase their electrical conductivity, and then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. Following transfer to isoamyl acetate, the specimens were dried in a critical point dryer (HCP-1; Hitachi Koki, Tokyo, Japan) and coated with approximately 1 nm platinum in an ion coater (E-102, Hitachi). Metal-coated specimens were observed via field emission SEM (S-4700, Hitachi) at 25 kV. Four-week-old quinoa and Arabidopsis plants were subjected to wind stress treatment. A fan was used to generate a consistent wind current with a speed of 20–30 cm/s that struck the quinoa shoot apex from above throughout the treatment period of 4 weeks. After completing the stress treatment, the degree of damage to the shoot apex was evaluated and compared with that in untreated plants. One-month-old quinoa plants were irradiated with fluorescent UV-B lamps (T-15M, Vilber Lourmat, France) with a cellulose acetate film to filter out UV-C. A distance of approximately 30 cm was maintained between the tops of the plants and the UV-B lamp. UV-B intensity was measured with a Solarmeter Model 6.2 UVB (Solar Light Company, Glenside, PA, USA). UV-B treatments were conducted at 1.5 W/m2 for 4 h. Two weeks after treatment, the degree of damage to the shoot apex was evaluated and compared with that in untreated plants. One-month-old quinoa plants were subjected to salt stress treatment by adding 2 L of 0.4 M NaCl solution on days 1 and 3, and 4 L of 0.6 M NaCl solution after 9 days (Fig. 4h). An equal amount of water was added to the control group (non-treated) on the same days as the salt treatments (Fig. 4h). Three weeks after salt treatment, the plants were photographed and the fresh weights of the shoots were measured. The Na+ contents of the tissue containing the leaf lamina were measured using a LAQUAtwin-Na-11 (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). To investigate the accumulation of salt on EBCs in salt stress treatment, a paintbrush was used to remove EBCs from leaves under a microscope, and the Na+ contents of leaf lamina with or without EBCs in the same leaf were measured (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Accumulation of salt was expressed as relative Na+ content, with the value in a non-brushed leaf was defined as 100%. The fourth to sixth expanded leaves from the top of the plant subjected to the salt treatment were used for this experiment. Soil electrical conductivity was measured using a LAQUAtwin-B-771 (Horiba). The soil electrical conductivities of the salt-treated and untreated plots in this experiment were 48.20 and 0.82 dS/m, respectively. One-month-old quinoa plants were subjected to heat treatment at 42 °C for 10 days. Two weeks after heat treatment, the plants were photographed, and the fresh weights of the shoots were measured. Three-week-old plants were subjected to progressive drought treatment by withholding water for 6–12 days. Then, the plants were watered again and grown for a further 4 days before survival rates were determined. WT plants exposed to drought for more than 10 days were severely damaged. Therefore, we withheld water for 10 days for the evaluation of drought-stress tolerance in WT and mutant plants. Drought treatment was confirmed by the expression of drought stress–induced genes (CqHSP20 and CqNCED3). Leaves of similar developmental stages taken before and after drought treatment were used to measure electrolyte leakage, as described in a previous report. To isolate the gene affected in the rebc1 mutant, a heterozygous line of the rebc1 mutant was grown to the four-leaf stage for phenotyping. Twenty-five plants of each of the WT and rebc phenotypes were pooled, and genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Pooled DNA from the WT and rebc1 mutants was sequenced. Paired-end reads of 150 bp from each of the two pools were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq X System; sequencing was performed by Macrogen Japan (Kyoto, Japan). The reads used in this study are available from the DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI under the accession numbers DRX138189 (rebc1 mutant pool) and DRX138190 (WT pool). Low-quality reads and adaptors in short reads from the rebc1 pool were trimmed using Trimmomatic-0.32 with the following settings: SLIDINGWINDOW:10:20 LEADING:15 TRAILING:10 MINLEN:40. Reads from the WT pool were trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.32 with the following settings: HEADCROP:1 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 LEADING:20 TRAILING:20 MINLEN:40. Adaptor sequences were CACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and ACCGCTCTTCCGATCTGTAA. WT-specific short reads were identified using customized Python scripts (https://github.com/Comai-Lab/kmer-extract-by-trigger-site) with k = 37. On the basis of WT-specific short reads, we assembled scaffolds using Velvet 1.2.10. A homology search of these scaffolds and predicted genes in the Quinoa Genome DataBase was conducted using BLASTN, and scaffolds homologous to the predicted genes with a blast score > 200 were identified. Next, we removed scaffolds that were similar to transposable elements. Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) 0.7.12 alignments were conducted using the bwa aln command with the setting –n 1 and the bwa samse command with the settings. Nucleotide sites at which the WT carried heterozygous WT and mutant alleles and the mutant pool carried homozygous mutant alleles were detected using SAMtools tview 1.4.1. To filter out low-quality short reads, we excluded reads for which >10% of the sequenced nucleotides had a Phred quality score <30. Candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were then analyzed using MutMap pipeline ver. 1.4.4 (http://genome-e.ibrc.or.jp/home/bioinformatics-team/mutmap). In the MutMap pipeline, alignment was conducted using BWA, and alignment files were converted to SAM/BAM files using SAMtools. In this pipeline, short reads obtained from the WT pool were aligned to the mutant pool reference sequence, which was developed by replacing nucleotides of the public quinoa reference genome with SNPs (SNP index > 0.9) detected by aligning the short reads obtained from the mutant pool. The SNP indexes at all SNP positions were then calculated for the WT pool. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) to eliminate genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using the Takara RNA PCR Kit (AMV) Ver. 3.0 (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) with oligo(dT) primers. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). We obtained the full-length open reading frame sequences of REBC (XM_021859495), REBC1-like1 (XM_021883470), REBC-like2 (XM_021859173), CqTTG1-like1 (XM_021907203), and CqTTG1-like2 (XM_021869994) from the NCBI gene database. To construct a plasmid for transient complementation experiments, the 2.5-kbp upstream region and the open reading frame region of the REBC gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For binding of the amplified fragments, the primers used for amplification were designed to overlap by 20 bp with the fragments to be linked (Supplementary Table 8). The amplified PCR fragments were introduced into pCAMBIA1380 (CAMBIA, Canberra, Australia) by Gibson assembly (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The resultant plasmid was introduced into Rhizobium rhizogenes (ATCC 15834) by electroporation using Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA) to prepare a transformant. To prepare a control transformant, a plasmid expressing AcGFP1 was introduced into R. rhizogenes. Quinoa seeds were germinated on MS plates containing 4.3 g/L MS (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), 1.5% sucrose, and 2.5 g/L Gelrite (Fujifilm) and kept at 23 °C under continuous light conditions for 2 weeks, the time required for rebc phenotype confirmation. Infection of quinoa with transformed R. rhizogenes was conducted as described previously. PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) and oligonucleotides containing a restriction enzyme cleavage site were used for PCR amplification (Supplementary Table 8). The amplified fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then introduced into the binary vector pCAMBIA1301MdNcoI. An ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to sequence the resultant plasmids. To generate transgenic Arabidopsis plants, binary plasmids were introduced into a ttg1-21 mutant of Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation using the floral dip method. Transgenic plants were selected on a 0.8% (w/v) agar MS medium containing 50 µg/mL hygromycin. For each transgenic line, 10 or more independent plants were produced. Homozygous T3 plants were used for further analysis. The High-Capacity cDNA RT Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with random primers was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA from 500 ng of total RNA. RT-PCR was conducted using GeneAtlas 322 (Astec, Shime, Japan) with Taq DNA Polymerase (NEB). The procedure for amplification of the candidate transcripts consisted of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. CqMON1 and AtEF1α were used as internal controls for relative gene expression in quinoa and Arabidopsis, respectively. Primer pairs are listed in Supplementary Table 8. Secondary structure prediction suggested that the REBC protein has a β-rich conformation (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/). Because the amino acid sequence alignment initially identified no candidate structure for approximately 100 of the N-terminal residues of REBC, the three-dimensional structure was modeled for residues 102–448. F-box/WD-repeat protein 1A (PDB Code, 1p22) was used as the initial structure for the modeling. The three-dimensional structure of the REBC protein was predicted using Modeler ver. 9.16 and Phyre2 and displayed using MOLMOL. To produce the REBC protein in E. coli, PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) and oligonucleotides containing a restriction enzyme cleavage site were used to conduct PCR amplification (Supplementary Table 8). The amplified fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and then introduced into the expression vector pCold-TF DNA (Takara Bio). An ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) was used to sequence the resultant plasmids. Trigger factor (TF)–REBC fusion protein and TF–rebc1 fusion protein were produced according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Crude extract for immunoblot analysis was prepared using PBS (pH 7.4). To detect REBC protein in quinoa, crude extract was prepared from quinoa leaves by grinding the leaves into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen, followed by sonication in extraction buffer [PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton X-100, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)]. The resultant cell extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the collected supernatants were used for subsequent analysis. An aliquot of crude extract (5 µL of E. coli extract and 10 µL of plant extract) was added to loading buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol). After boiling for 5 min, the proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) and visualized using Coomassie Blue R250 (Bio-Rad). Separated proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 1% (w/v) non-fat dry milk for 1 h, and then washed three times with TBS-T. The blocked membrane was then incubated for 1 h with anti-SNGDDDTEDTNSAG polyclonal rabbit IgG, (Scrum, Tokyo, Japan) (1:2000 dilution for E. coli extract and 1:500 dilution for plant extract) in blocking solution and washed. For visualization, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L chain) polyclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) was used at a dilution of 1: 5000. Chemi-Lumi One Ultra (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was used for detection. Fluorescence images were obtained using a LAS3000 image analyzer (Fujifilm). Cut leaves and shoot apices (1.0–1.5 mm × 2–3 mm) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at 4 °C. The specimens were dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in LR white. Ultra-thin sections were cut with a diamond knife and mounted on formvar-coated nickel grids. Sections were incubated with anti-SNGDDDTEDTNSAG polyclonal rabbit IgG and then reacted with 15 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (BBI Solutions, Crumlin, UK). After immunolabeling, sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. As a cytochemical control, specimens were incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune rabbit IgG. Samples were visualized by TEM (H-7650, Hitachi). The deduced amino acid sequences of REBC, REBC-like1, REBC-like2, CqTTG1-like1, and CqTTG1-like2 were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm with TTG1 and REBC isolated from quinoa, beet (Beta vulgaris), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus), and Arabidopsis. Bootstrap values shown at nodes were obtained from 5000 trials. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm in the MEGA7 software. RNA-seq analysis was conducted to determine comprehensive mRNA expression in the WT and rebc mutants. Pools were prepared from 10 individuals of the rebc phenotype, and the WT phenotype that were isolated from the rebc1 and rebc2 heterozygous lines. RNA was extracted from each pooled sample using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). For Illumina sequencing, 1 µg of RNA was used to prepare libraries according to the protocol for the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB). The libraries were subjected to 250 cycles of paired-end sequencing on MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). The sequence reads were filtered for quality in the FASTAQ format. The RNA-seq data from other groups (Experiment No. RX3124330–RX3124333) was obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). The reads were aligned to the Cq_PI614886_genome_V1_pseudomolecule reference sequence (http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/chenopodiumdb/) by HISAT2. After genes were predicted by StringTie using alignment data from HISAT2, the expression levels of each gene in each sample were compared using featureCounts. Genes with a total of ≤40 reads from four samples were discarded. Next, genes for which RNA expression was downregulated to less than half or upregulated more than twofold in both rebc mutants were selected (Supplementary Datas 1 and 2). Subcellular localization of the selected gene products was predicted using WolF PSORT (https://wolfpsort.hgc.jp/) (Supplementary Datas 1 and 2). Gene expression was compared with RNA-seq performed by other groups by converting to TPM values. Genes for which the TPM value was down- or upregulated by ≥ twofold in both rebc mutants were selected and added to the TPM value in EBCs (Supplementary Datas 3 and 4). Chlorophyll from 3-week-old plants was extracted with 100% dimethylformamide, and the absorbances of supernatants were measured at 646.8 and 663.8 nm. Chlorophyll content was calculated as previously described. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, i.e., the maximal quantum yield of fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and the light response curves of ETR, were measured with a JUNIOR-PAM fluorometer (Heinz-Walz Instruments, Effeltrich, Germany) and calculated as described previously. For measurement of Fv/Fm, plants were dark-adapted for 30 min before measurements were made. Student’s t test was computed to analyze the significant difference between two groups. Chi-squared test was used for segregation test. Asterisk indicated values differ significantly with the value at <0.05. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
The His6-tagged expression construct of SETD2 catalytic SET domain (amino acids 1347–1711, UniProt No: Q9BYW2) was kindly provided by Dr. Masoud Vedadi. The expression and the purification of the His6-tagged SETD2 protein was conducted as described previously. The domain constructs of the non-histone substrates were cloned by PCR using cDNA isolated from HEK293 cells as template. The domain boundaries of the non-histone substrates were designed with the Scooby domain prediction tool (http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/scoobywww/). For the introduction of the target lysine mutation to arginine, site-directed mutagenesis was used. H3K36 (29–43)-GST was cloned by Gibson-Assembly from an H3 (1–60) plasmid constructed by Dr. Rebekka Mauser. The ssK36-GST (29–43) and the ssK36M-GST (29–43) constructs were cloned by site-directed mutagenesis method using the H3K36 (29–43)-GST plasmid as template. As protein expression vector for all constructs, pGEX-6p2 was used. All cloning steps were confirmed by sequencing. The protein expression and purification of the GST-tagged non-histone substrate proteins and the H3K36 (29–43)-GST variant proteins were performed as described previously. For mammalian expression, the coding sequence of SETD2 (amino acids 1347–1711, UniProt No: Q9BYW2) was cloned into the pMulti-sgRNA-LacZ-DsRed (Addgene) by Gibson-Assembly. The H3K36 (29–43) and ssK36 (29–43) were cloned into the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using synthetic DNA sequences as inserts. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine (Sigma). The DsRed fused SETD2 was co-transfected with YFP-fused H3K36 (29–43) or ssK36 (29–43) into cells using polyethylenamine (Promega, according to the manufacturer’s instructions). Transfection efficiency and expression of the transgenes of HEK293 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry (MACSQuant VYB, Miltenyi Biotec) using the DsRed reporter. Data analysis was performed using the FlowJo software (Treestar). For methylation analysis, the cells were washed with PBS buffer (Sigma) 72 h after transfection and harvested by centrifuging at 525 × g for 5 min. The YFP-fused H3K36 (29–43) or ssK36 (29–43) protein was purified from mammalian cell extracts using GFP-Trap A beads (Chromotek) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min in SDS-gel loading buffer and resolved by 16% SDS-PAGE. Analysis was performed by Western Blot using as primary antibody H3K36me3 (ab9050, lot. GR3257952-1) or GFP antibody (Clontech, lot. 1404005) and as secondary antibody anti-rabbit HRP (GE Healthcare, lot. 9739638). Peptide arrays containing fifteen amino acid long peptides were synthesized using the SPOT synthesis method with an Autospot peptide array synthesizer (Intavis AG, Köln, Germany). After synthesis, the obtained membranes were pre-incubated in methylation buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 9, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mM DTT, 1.5 mM MgCl2) for 5 min on a shaker. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated in methylation buffer supplemented with 0.76 µM radioactively labeled AdoMet (PerkinElmer) and 3–6 µM SETD2 enzyme for 60 min on a shaker. After methylation, the membranes were washed 5 times for 5 min in wash buffer (100 mM NH4HCO3, 1% SDS) and incubated in amplify NAMP100V (GE Healthcare) for 5 min. This was followed by the exposure of the membranes to a hyperfilmTM high performance autoradiography (GE Healthcare) film at −80 °C in the dark. The films were developed with an Optimax Typ TR machine after different exposue times. For quantification the signal intensities were measured with the PhoretixTM software and analyzed with Microsoft Excel. The H3K36 (27–43) and the H3K36M (27–43) peptides were purchased from Intavis AG (Köln, Germany) and the ssK36 peptide (29–43) and the ssK36M peptide (29–43) were from Innovative Peptide Solutions (Berlin, Germany). If not indicated otherwise, peptide methylation reactions were performed using 20 µM peptide and 6 µM SETD2 in 20 µl methylation buffer supplemented with 0.76 µM radioactive labeled AdoMet (PerkinElmer) for 3 h at 25 °C. The reactions were halted by the addition of Tricine-SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubation for 5 min at 95 °C. Afterward the samples were separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE, which was followed by the incubation of the gel in amplify NAMP100V (GE Healthcare) for 45 min on a shaker and drying of the gel for 2 h at 55 °C in vacuum. The signals of the transferred radioactive labeled methyl groups were detected by autoradiography using a hyperfilmTM high performance autoradiography film (GE Healthcare) at −80 °C in the dark. The film was developed with an Optimax Typ TR machine after different exposure times. Time courses of ssK36 methylation were analyzed by fitting to an exponential reaction progress curve (Eq. 1). Initial rates of single turnover reactions were determined using the first derivative of eq. 1 at t = 0. Equation 1: Exponential reaction progress curve used to fit single turnover methylation kinetics (BL, baseline; F, Signal factor; t, time; kst, single turnover rate constant). Multiple turnover kinetics were determined using variable peptide concentrations (20–320 µM). Methylation levels were fitted to the Michaelis Menten model (equation 2). Equation 2: Michaelis–Menten model used to fit multiple turnover kinetics (v, reaction rate; cS, concentration of the substrate peptide; KM, Michaelis-Menten constant; vmax, turnover number). The ssK36 (29–43) peptide was used in a concentration of 20 µM. The H3K36M (27–43) and the ssK36M (29–43) peptide inhibitors were used in a concentration ranging from 0 to 320 µM. The peptide methylation experiments were performed as described above. The results were globally fitted by least squares fit with Microsoft Excel Solver module under standard settings (GRL non-linear) to equation 3, which describes a competitive inhibition steady-state model. Equation 3: Competitive inhibition model used to fit multiple turnover inhibition kinetics (v, reaction rate; cS, concentration of the substrate peptide; cI, concentration of the inhibitor peptide; KM, Michaelis–Menten constant; KI, inhibition constant). Protein methylation reactions were performed in 40 µl methylation buffer containing 0.76 µM radioactive labeled AdoMet (PerkinElmer), approximately 20 µg of substrate protein and 6 µM SETD2 enzyme (if not otherwise indicated) for 3 h at 25 °C. Thereafter, the reaction was halted by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubation of the samples for 5 min at 95 °C. Afterward, the samples were separated by a 16% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-gel was then incubated in amplify NAMP100V (GE Healthcare) for 45 min on a shaker and dried for 90 min at 65 °C in vacuum. The radioactive methylation signal was detected by a hyperfilmTM high performance autoradiography film (GE Healthcare) at −80 °C in the dark. The films were developed with an Optimax Typ TR machine after different periods of time. The recombinant H3.1 protein (M2503S) was purchased from NEB. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine (Sigma). HEK293 cell pellets was thawed on ice and afterward resuspended in ice cold resuspension buffer (RB) (15 mM Tris/HCl pH 8, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, 200 µM PMSF). Thereafter, the cells were centrifuged at 530 g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. These two steps were repeated. Afterward, the cells were resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of ice cold RB and lysis buffer (15 mM Tris/HCl pH 8, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, 200 µM PMSF, 0.6% NP-40) and lysed for 10 min on ice. Then, the cells were centrifuged at 530 × g, for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. The nuclei were resuspended in RB and transferred into a new chilled eppendorf tube. The nuclei were centrifuged at 600 × g, for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. This step was followed by a washing step of the nuclei with RB and another centrifugation of the nuclei at 600 × g, for 5 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the nuclei were resuspended in RB and the DNA concentration was measured with the NanoDrop spectrometer. After this step, the nuclei were digested with micrococcal nuclease (1 µl per 300–350 ng/µl) (NEB, M0247S) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EGTA-EDTA buffer (1/10 of the volume) and this was followed by centrifugation at maximum speed, for 10 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the supernatant was transferred into a new chilled eppendorf tube and the DNA concentration was measured with the NanoDrop spectrometer. Individual histone proteins were overexpressed in BL21 DE3 codon plus cells. The cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.6, induced for 4 h with 1 mM isopropyl-. -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 20 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 40 mM sodium acetate pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM lysine, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 6 M urea and 200 mM NaCl, and disrupted by sonication (5 min of sonication, with 40% power). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 h) and passed through a 0.45 µm syringe filter to remove particulate matter. The solution was then passed over a 5 ml SP HP cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) which was equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing with additional 5 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer, the histone proteins were eluted using a salt gradient from 200 to 800 mM NaCl. Fractions containing pure histone proteins were dialyzed against water and subsequently lyophilized and stored at 4 °C. Lyophilized aliquots of histone proteins were dissolved in unfolding buffer containing 7 M guanidiniumchloride, 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, and 5 mM DTT for 30 min. Concentration was determined by spectrophotometry and the proteins were pooled according to a molar ratio of 1 (H3, H4) to 1.2 (H2A, H2B) to prevent the formation of free (H3-H4)2 tetramers. The mixture was dialyzed against refolding buffer containing 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Fully reconstituted histone octamers were separated from (H2A-H2B) dimers by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200PG column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with refolding buffer. Fractions containing pure histone octamers were concentrated tenfold using Amicon spin filters (Merck), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. A 240 bp sequence containing the Widom 601 sequence was amplified by PCR and purified using the Nucleospin PCR cleanup kit (Macherey-Nagel). Purified DNA and histone octamers were mixed in equimolar ratio together with 5 M NaCl to a final DNA concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and 2 M NaCl. The sample was dialyzed against high salt buffer (2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) which was continuously replaced by low salt buffer (same with 250 mM NaCl) over a time of 24 h. Successful nucleosome assembly was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Wild-type human SETD2 catalytic domain (residues 1435–1711) was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells and purified in the form of His-tagged proteins as previously described. Briefly, N-terminal His-tagged plasmids were transformed into E. coli (DE3) RIL cells and, protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM IPTG at 14 °C for 16 h. Proteins were purified using Ni-NTA affinity agarose resin (QIAGEN), followed by running through cation-exchange (HiTrap SP HP 5 mL, GE Healthcare) and size-exclusion (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) columns in a final buffer of 25 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl. For ternary complex crystal growth, the SETD2 protein (10 mg/ml) was incubated with AdoMet and the ssK36M peptide at a molar ratio of 1:10:5. The crystallization condition was optimized based on a previously reported condition for the crystal growth of a SETD2 ternary complex. Crystals were obtained via the hanging drop method by mixing 1 μL of the protein complex and 1 μL of reservoir solution (0.2 M KSCN, 0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 8.5, and 26% PEG 3350) at 18 °C. Next, the crystals were mounted and soaked in a cryo-protectant composed of reservoir solution supplemented with 10–20% glycerol and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Diffraction experiments were conducted initially on a rotating copper anode and, later, at Advanced Photon Source beam line 24-ID-E. Diffraction images were processed with XDS and AIMLESS. Coordinates from isomorphous PDB entry 5JLB chain A were refined against these diffraction data using DIMPLE/REFMAC. The model was interactively rebuilt in COOT and further refined in REFMAC, AUTOBUSTER (BUSTER. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Global Phasing Ltd.) and PHENIX. The latest round of refinement was performed with BUSTER against the weaker, but earlier collected, copper anode data, which we preferred due to its lower radiation load and concerns about radiation-induced decarboxylation of glutamate residues. Two conformations were modeled for the side chain of ssK36M R37 to denote uncertainty in the true coordinates, not to denote the observation of any specific conformation. We failed to fit a favored arginine rotamer to the R37 difference electron density. Diffraction data were deposited at the Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography (proteindiffraction.org) as entry SETD2_HR606-6vdb (https://proteindiffraction.org/project/SETD2_HR606_6vdb/). The current atomic model has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) as entry 6VDB (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6VDB). The PDB2PQR webserver has been used to prepare some of the illustrations. All experiments were conducted in replicates as indicated.

11 men (aged 30–45 years) with overweight/obesity (body mass index [BMI] 27–35 kg m−2) following a sedentary lifestyle (<150 min wk−1 exercise and >3 h d−1 sitting) were recruited to participate. Sample size was choosen based on previous published research. Clinical characteristics of the study participants have been previously reported. First enrollment of participants was on 30/01/2017, and trial was completed by 22/06/2017. Measures of insulin sensitivity (i.e. oral glucose tolerance or euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp tests) were not performed in this cohort. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Australian Catholic University (2016-215H) and informed written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study employed two experimental dietary conditions whereby the participants consumed prepared meals consisting of ~32% of total energy intake (TEI) from carbohydrate, ~49% TEI from fat, and ~19% of TEI from protein for five days. Participants were randomized to start either EXF or TRF using computer generated random numbers placed in sealed opaque envelopes (block-randomization, n = 4), and were revealed to laboratory personel after completion of baseline measurements.  After this, the investigators were not blinded for group allocation. The timing of meals differed between the two conditions, where energy was either consumed between a 15 h “extended” feeding (EXF) window of 0700 to 2200 h or an 8 h “time-restricted” feeding (TRF) window of 1000–1800 h. Participants consumed the meals at standardized times within ±30 min (at 0700, 1400 and 2100 h for EXF and at 1000, 1300, and 1700 h for TRF) throughout both experimental conditions. On the fifth day of the experimental conditions, participants arrived at the laboratory at ~0630 h after an overnight fast and remained in the laboratory until 0730 h the following day (i.e. for a 24 h period) in order to obtain a total of six skeletal muscle biopsies and blood samples every 4 h (Supplementary Fig. 1). Participants were free-living in the laboratory, aside from a structured walk period (~700 m) 1 h after each meal (i.e. 3 × day). At ~2230 h participants were taken to the Nursing Simulation Suite at ACU for the overnight portion of the 24-h condition period. Throughout the 24 h laboratory visit, vastus lateralis muscle biopsies (~150-300 mg) were obtained every 4 h (from 0700 h) using local anesthesia (2–3 mL of 1% Xylocaine (lignocaine)) and a 6 mm Bergstrom needle modified with suction, and were immediately frozen using liquid nitrogen before being stored at −80 °C for later analysis. The participants were in natural light during the day and slept in a darkened room during the night. Muscle biopsies and blood samples were taken without turning on the lights, with the doctor using a miniature head-mounted portable light source as the only illumination. An in-dwelling venous catheter was inserted and blood (5 mL Serum clot activator, Greiner Bio-One) was collected prior to each muscle biopsy while participants were supine. Throughout the 24 h sampling period, cannulas were kept patent with regular saline (0.9% NaCl) flushes. The serum samples remained at room temperature for 30 min before centrifuging at 3000 g, for 10 min at 4 °C and was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. Metabolomics analysis was performed by Metabolon Inc. (Durham, NC), as described. Briefly, small biochemicals from skeletal muscle and serum were methanol extracted and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS; positive mode), UPLC-MS/MS (negative mode) and gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS platform utilized a Waters Acquity UPLC with Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm columns and a ThermoFisher LTQ MS, which included an electrospray ionization source and a linear ion-trap mass analyzer. Samples destined for analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 18 h prior to being derivatized using bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were separated on a 5% phenyldimethyl silicone column with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60 °C to 340 °C within a 17-min period. All samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS operated at unit mass resolving power with electron impact ionization and a 50–750 atomic mass unit scan range. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra and were curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon, Inc. Missing data were imputed using k-nearest neighbor imputation. Raw signal intensity of all metabolites detected are presented in Supplementary Data 2. RNA quality was assed using the Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent Technologies) and RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold protocol (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina) with 38- bp paired end. Reads were mapped to ENSEMBL hg38 release 92 using STAR aligner, and transcripts were counted with FeatureCounts using gencode release 27. Sequencing depth ranged from 52.9 to 10.4 million with an average of 20.5 million reads. Reads were filtered using filterbyExpression, with minimum count of 10. Transcriptomic data is deposited under accession number GSE129843. Periodic features in each feeding protocol were identified using the non-parametric RAIN algorithm, with an independent method (to avoid false positive increasing trends), and delta.period of 12 allowing for the detection of features with a period of 12–28 h. Rhythmic features were defined as any feature with a Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate adjusted p value (FDR) < 0.05, and periods of 12 or 24. Amplitude, MESOR, and acrophase were detected using the non-linear cosinor regression tool CircaCompare, using Y = k +  ⍺cos[τ(t − φ)] and the period defined by RAIN. Because many features violated assumptions for cosinor regression, we power transformed the data using the lambda calculated from boxcoxfit, unless lambda was 0, or greater or smaller than 2, where we log10 transformed the data. The FDR obtained by RAIN was considered as the p value of rhythmicity for the feeding protocols, and comparisons in acrophase, MESOR and amplitude between EXF and TRF were only investigated in features with significant FDR after both feeding protocols, using CircaCompare. A schematic of the bioinformatic pipeline is presented in supplementary Fig. 4. Amplitudes and MESORs were then back transformed using lambda, and for subsequent analysis. Density plot comparisons were performed using two tailed Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Circadian misalignment was calculated by taking the timepoint with the maximal value of cortisol and subtracting the timepoint of the maximal value for each participant. Gene ontology molecular function enrichment, and metabolite class enrichment using Metabolon super-pathway and sub-pathway definitions as sets, was performed using compareClucter function from ClusterProfiler with default settings. t-SNE analysis was performed using Rtsne package, with perplexity of 30 for skeletal muscle gene expression and serum metabolite content, and perplexity of 10 for skeletal muscle metabolite content. PCA analysis was performed on z-score transformed using the prcomp function. Following recruitment, no samples or features were excluded from the analysis. The study was approved by the ACU Human Research Ethics Committee (2016-215H). Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Goberdhan and UAS-Yki.V5 by K. Irvine. To create eyeless-driven GFP-labelled clones, the MARCM system was used. Flies with the genotype ey(3.5)-FLP1; act > y+ > gal4,UAS-GFP; FRT82B, tub-gal80 were crossed to flies with the following genotypes: (1) UAS-LacZ; FRT82B; (2) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk/TM6b; (3) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-bnl/TM6b; (4) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-bnl/TM6b; (5) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-ImpL2/TM6b; (6) UAS-ras1, UAS-ImpL2; FRT82B, csk/TM6b; (7) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-Pvf1/TM6b; (8) UAS-ras1, UAS-Pvf1; FRT82B, csk/TM6b; (9) UAS-ras1, UAS-Pvf2; FRT82B, csk/TM2; (10) UAS-ras1, UAS-Pvf2; FRT82B, csk/TM2; (11) UAS-ras1, UAS-btl; FRT82B, csk/TM6b; (12) UAS-ras1, UAS-btl; FRT82B, csk/TM6b; (13) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-mnd/TM6b; (14) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-JhI-21/TM6b; (15) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-slif/TM6b; (16) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-CG8785/TM6b; (17) UAS-ras1, UAS-path; FRT82B, csk/TM6b; (18) UAS-ras1, UAS-path; FRT82B, csk/TM6b; (19) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-CG1139/TM6b; (20) UAS-ras1, CG1139; FRT82B, csk/MKRS; (21) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-wts; (22) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-yki; (23) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, csk, UAS-path/TM6b; (24) UAS-ras1, UAS-CG1139; FRT82B, csk/MKRS; (25) FRT82B, UAS-path; (16) UAS-CG1139; FRT82B; (26) UAS-ras1, UAS-Tor; FRT82B, csk/MKRS; (27) UAS-ras1; FRT82B, UAS-S6K, csk/TM6b; (28) UAS-ras1, UAS-Tor; FRT82B, csk, UAS-path/TM6b. To block ecdysone signalling, we used a temperature-sensitive allele of ecdysoneless (ecd). Flies with the genotype ey(3.5)-FLP1; act > y + > gal4, UAS-GFP; ecd, FRT82B, tub-gal80 were crossed with UAS-ras1; ecd, FRT82B, csk/TM6b flies and reared at 25 °C. At second instar larval stage (day 8 in 25 °C), cultures were switched to a restrictive temperature of 29 °C. To carry out fat body-specific genetic alterations, FB-gal4 flies were crossed with UAS-LacZ or UAS-bnl. To carry out muscle-specific genetic alterations, mhc-gal4 flies were crossed with: (1) UAS-LacZ, (2) UAS-btl.λ, (3) UAS-rl, (4) UAS-btl.λ, rl and (5) UAS-btl.λ, rl. Cultures were carried out on a modified Bloomington semi-defined medium (https://bdsc.indiana.edu/information/recipes/germanfood.html), containing sucrose (0.15 and 1.0 M in CD and HSD, respectively) as the only purified sugar source. Ingredients were obtained from; Agar (Fisher Scientific; BP2641-1), Brewer’s Yeast (MP Biomedicals; 903312, Lot: BCBN0171V), Yeast Extract (Sigma-Aldrich; 70161), Peptone (Sigma-Aldrich; 82303), Sucrose (Fisher Scientific; S/8560/63), Magnesium sulfate hexahydrate (Fluka; 00627), Calcium chloride dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich; 223506), Propionic acid (Sigma-Aldrich; P1386), p-Hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich; H5501). For dietary supplementation experiments, L-proline (Sigma-Aldrich; P5607), D-proline (Sigma-Aldrich; 858919), L-glycine (VWR Chemicals; 101196X), L-alanine (Sigma-Aldrich; 7627), L-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich; T0254), Indole-5-carboxylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich; I5400) and IPA (Sigma-Aldrich; 57400) were added to CD or HSD. Cultures were performed at 25 °C unless otherwise noted. HSD feeding led to a developmental delay in reaching the third-instar larval stage; all experiments were performed on late third-instar larvae at day 8 after egg laying (CD) and day 14 after egg laying (HSD) unless otherwise noted. Pancreatic cancer cell line Panc 04.03 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were plated in 96-well plates in a density of 2500 cells/well and cultured in RPMI, DMEM, DMEM + 1 mM proline, with or without 1 mM IPA. All media was supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 10% dialysed foetal calf serum (3000 Da MWCO) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Proliferation was measured for 120 h using the IncuCYTE live cell imaging system (Essen Biosciences). Datapoints were taken every 2 h. Growth rates were calculated using the Growthcurver package in R (ver. 0.3.0). Tissue was dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 30′ on ice, washed in PBS-T, incubated with primary antibody in PAXDG (PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.3% deoxycholate and 5% goat serum), followed by washing and incubation with secondary antibody in PAXDG and subsequent mounting in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies used were: rat anti-myosin (ab51098; Abcam; 1:100) and mouse anti-pERK (M-8159; Sigma; 1:50). Polyclonal rabbit anti-CG1139 (1:200) was purified by New England Peptide Inc., MA, USA. An amino acid sequence 26–40 was selected as the epitope. The following primary antibodies were kindly gifted to us: rat anti-bnl (M. Krasnow; 1:50), guinea pig anti-Path (J. Parrish; 1:200) and rabbit anti-phospho-Drosophila S6 (pS6) (A. Teleman; 1:500). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 conjugated anti-rat antibody (A-11006 and A-11077; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200), Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (A-11031; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200), Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (A-11036; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200) and Alexa-568 conjugated anti-guinea pig antibody (A-11075; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:200). Rhodamine phalloidin (R415; Invitrogen; 1:500) was used to visualise F-actin. Tissue was dissected in PBS, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 30′ on ice, incubated with 10 μg/mL Nile Red stain (N1142; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 30′ on ice followed by washing and subsequent mounting in Vectashield with DAPI. Midguts were dissected in PBS on ice, incubated in 5 μg/ml of acridine orange (A1301: Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by washing and subsequent mounting in Vectashield with DAPI. Samples were imaged immediately with the Leica SP5 II confocal microscope and Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software (Leica Microsystems). Larvae were placed on food containing 1% FCF-blue dye for 90 min and washed in dH2O to remove excess dye from their cuticle. Larvae were imaged with Leica DFC 3000 G digital camera to visualise blue food in the gut, or retained for feeding quantification. For feeding quantification five larvae were pooled into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes each containing 70 μl dH2O, followed by homogenisation with motorised pestle and mortar, and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 RCF. 40 μl of supernatant from each sample was transferred to a transparent 96-well plate and absorbance was measured at 629 nm in BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega Microplate reader. Larvae were placed on food containing 1% FCF-blue dye overnight, with a minimum of ten animals per vial. Larvae were washed in dH2O to remove excess dye from their cuticle and scored as ‘Smurfs’ if blue dye was only visible in the gut, or ‘Non-smurfs’, if blue dye was visible across the whole animal. Individual larvae were washed and dissected in PBS. Larval body-wall muscle was stained with Rhodamine phalloidin (R415; Invitrogen; 1:500) to visualise F-actin. Individual animals were scored into categories each representing the strength of muscle wasting from either ‘none’; ‘minor’; ‘moderate’ or ‘strong’ (Supplementary Fig. 1f–i). Scores were assigned based on wasting of the ventral longitudinal, lateral oblique and lateral longitudinal muscles centred around the fourth abdominal segment (A4) of the larval body wall and each hemisegment was used as an internal control (Supplementary Fig. 1e). A minimum of 30 animals were scored per condition. Body-wall muscle staining and quantification was performed on animals from day 8 (CD), day 10 (early stage; HSD), day 14 (mid stage; HSD) and day 16 (late stage; HSD) after egg laying. Larval images were acquired with Leica M165 FC fluorescent microscope equipped with Leica DFC 3000 G digital camera. Eye disc images were acquired with Leica M165 FC fluorescent microscope equipped with S-View SXY-I30 digital camera. Confocal images were acquired with Leica SP5 II confocal microscope and Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software (ver. 4.6.1) (Leica Microsystems). Larval GFP/brightfield overlay images were compiled with Adobe Photoshop software. Quantification of staining intensity for Bnl, Path, CG1139 and phospho-Drosophila ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), each stained with Alexa-568 secondary antibody, was carried out on GFP-positive clones. A minimum of three samples per condition were analysed in ImageJ software (ver. 2.0.0-rc-43) using a custom-made macro written by D. Dormann. RGB images were first converted to tagged image file format (tiff), channels were split and the green channel was thresholded for GFP intensity to allow for the identification of GFP-positive clone area. For the GFP-positive clone area, mean pixel intensity was calculated across the red channel. A minimum of three samples per condition were analysed in ImageJ software (ver. 2.0.0-rc-43) using a custom-made macro written by D. Dormann. Images were first converted to tiff format and RGB channels were split. The eye disc area was manually defined, based on the outline of DAPI staining in the red channel. The green channel was thresholded for GFP intensity to allow for the identification of GFP-positive clones within the user-defined eye disc. Clone area was subsequently calculated. Larvae were maintained in normal culture conditions up until the point of video recording. Individual larvae were picked and placed onto the centre of an agar plate at room temperature and recorded immediately. Video plate recordings were carried out with use of a Teledyne DALSA Genie Nano Camera (G3-GM11-M2420) using Gecko GigE Video Recorder software (v2.0.3.1; www.visionexperts.co.uk), at 25 frames per second, ensuring a sharp contrast between the larva and background. Twenty individual larvae were recorded per condition up to a maximum of 5 min or until the larva was no longer in the field of view. Individual videos—each corresponding to one larva—were segmented, tracked and skeletonised using Tierpsy Tracker. Two hundred and fifty-six defined features, previously determined to be useful in classifying behaviour in C. elegans, were extracted from the tracking data and compared between conditions. Correction for multiple testing was applied using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate to 0.05. Larvae were washed in PBS and dissected in RNALater solution. Total RNA was extracted from pooled dissected tissue using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit. First-strand DNA was synthesised with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed by mixing cDNA samples with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), ROX passive reference dye (Bio-Rad) and the relevant primers in a 96-well plate. Analysis was carried out on a 7900HT Real-Time PCR system with Applied Biosystems Software (SDS v2.4) (Applied Biosystems). Data analysis was carried out in Microsoft Excel (16.16.4). At least three independent biological replicates and two technical replicates were used. Expression values were normalised to Act88F. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1. RNA from pooled dissected tissue was extracted with the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit. A minimum of three samples were prepared for each genotype. RNA-seq libraries were prepared from a minimum of 10 ng of total RNA using the Illumina Truseq mRNA stranded library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Library quality was checked on a Bioanalyser HS DNA chip and concentrations were estimated by Qubit measurement. Libraries were pooled in equimolar quantities and sequenced on a Hiseq2500 using paired end 100 bp reads. At least 35 million reads passing filter were achieved per sample. After demultiplexing, raw or trimmed RNA-Seq reads were aligned against Ensembl Drosophila genome reference sequence assembly (dm3) and transcript annotations using TopHat2. Trim Galore, developed at The Babraham Institute by Felix Krueger (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/), was applied for trimming adaptor and low-quality reads. For differential gene expression analysis, gene-based read counts were then obtained using the featureCounts function from Rsubread Bioconductor package. Differential expression analysis was performed on the counts data using DESeq2 Bioconductor package. From tumour RNA-sequencing data, putative tumour-secreted factors were annotated based on identification of genes labelled with the GO term ‘extracellular’ or presence of the signal peptide sequence as identified by the signal peptide database (http://www.signalpeptide.de). GSEA was carried out using a ranked gene list based on Wald statistics from DESeq2 results. MSigDB gene sets from ‘H’, ‘C2’ and ‘C5’ collections were used and only considered where FDR q value < 0.25. Normalised enrichment scores were calculated for multiple terms within functional categories. Results were displayed as cumulative normalised enrichment score, as previously published. Pooled haemolymph was collected from multiple animals on ice to a combined minimum sample volume of 25 μl. Each sample was mixed with 225 μl of methanol containing internal standards (IS) (50 μm). Then, chloroform (250 μl) and Milli-Q water (100 μl) were added, mixed and centrifuged. The water layer was filtrated through a 5-kDa cut-off filter to remove macromolecules. Filtrate was centrifugally concentrated and resuspended in 25 μl of ultrapure water prior to measurement. Targeted metabolomic analyses were performed by the Human Metabolome Technologies Inc., Yamagata, Japan (HMT). CE-MS was performed using Agilent CE-TOFMS Machine (CE-TOFMS) and Agilent 6460 TripleQuad LC/MS Machine (CE-QqQMS)(Agilent Technologies). Peaks detected in CE-TOFMS analysis were extracted using automatic integration software (MasterHands ver.2.17.1.11 developed at Keio University) and those in CE-QqQMS analysis were extracted using automatic integration software (MassHunter Quantitative Analysis B.06.00 Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in order to obtain peak information including m/z, migration time (MT) and peak area. Putative metabolites were assigned from peak alignments based on the HMT metabolite database on the basis of m/z and MT. Relative peak values were calculated based on IS and normalised to sample volumes. Absolute quantification was calculated by normalising the peak area of each metabolite with respect to the area of the IS and by using standard curves, which were obtained by three-point calibrations. For haemolymph samples, 214 metabolites (135 metabolites in cation mode and 79 metabolites in anion mode, respectively) were annotated based on the HMT metabolite database, including 3-methylhistidine and proline. Frozen tissue samples (15 pooled tumours per replicate) or haemolymph samples (1 µL per replicate) were extracted with 300 µL of extraction solvent (water/methanol, 20:80 v/v). The extraction solvent contained IS at 150 ng/mL using either L-proline-2,5,5-d3 (Sigma) or 13C515N-L-proline (Sigma), depending on the experiment. Samples were sonicated using an ultrasonic water bath (15 min) and centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min, 5 °C). An aliquot of the supernatant (180 µL) was then filtered into a 96-well V-bottom plate using a 96-well filter plate (PTFE 0.45 µm). Pooled quality controls were created for each batch by pooling equal aliquots of each study sample in the batch, in order to assess technical reproducibility. Chromatographic analyses were carried out on a Vanquish Flex Binary UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific Inc., MA, USA) coupled to a benchtop hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany). Separation was achieved using an Accucore 150 Amide HILIC column (Thermo Scientific, 150 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm) equipped with a guard column (Thermo Scientific, 30 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm), both held at a temperature of 40 °C and a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Mobile phases were 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate/acetonitrile (10:90 v/v) (solvent A) and 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate/acetonitrile/water (10:10:80 v/v) (solvent B). The gradient elution was performed with a 25–47% solvent B gradient over 14 min, held at 47% B for 4 min and returning to 25% B at 20 min. The column was equilibrated for 10 min, yielding a total run time of 30 min. Ionisation was performed in the positive ionisation mode using a heated electrospray ionisation source, with the following parameters: spray voltage 3.0 KV, heater temperature 330 °C, capillary temperature 320 °C, S-lens RF level 50, sheath and auxiliary gas flow rate, 35 and 10 units, respectively. The mass accuracy was calibrated prior to sample analysis. Mass spectrometric data were acquired in profile mode using the parallel reaction monitoring method with compound-specific settings defined in the inclusion list (Supplementary Table 2). Further acquisition settings were MS2 resolution of 17,500 (at m/z 200) and an isolation window of m/z 1.2. Nitrogen was utilised as collision gas in the higher energy collisional dissociation cell with normalised collision energy as summarised in Supplementary Table 2. Automatic gain control was set to 1e5 and maximum injection time 100 ms. Xcalibur version 4.1 was used for data acquisition and processing. Specific fragment ions were used in the data processing in order to detect and quantify each compound unequivocally. Relative quantification is reported based on the peak area ratio of the analyte and the respective IS. Unless otherwise stated, all statistical analyses were carried out with an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test in GraphPad Prism software (v.7.0d) where P ≤ 0.0001 = ****; 0.0001 < P ≤ 0.001 = ***; 0.001 < P ≤ 0.01 = **; 0.01 < P ≤ 0.05 = *; P > 0.05 = not significant. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
All Drosophila lines generated and used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Flies were reared under standard conditions. Oligos are listed in Supplementary Table 2. For quantification of fluorescent images and western blots, p-values were calculated using the two-tailed T-test for two independent means. For retinal degeneration assays, p values were calculated through Log-rank analysis using the Mantel-Cox test. To generate a Deficiency line deleting the eIF2D locus, we employed the FRT-mediated recombination strategy using two insertion lines PBac{PB}CG14512[c06309] and PBac{WH}eIF2D[f04182]. eIF2D rescue transgenes (depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1a), were amplified using a BACPAC plasmid (CH321-74G8) as template. For the eIF2D rescue transgene, the WT rescue plasmid was cut with unique sites Bsu36I and StuI and replaced with a corresponding D109A mutation-bearing DNA fragment generated by gene synthesis. The rescue fragments were cloned into the EcoR1 site in p-attB by InFusion assembly (ClonTech) and injected into embryos for targeted insertion into the attP2 locus. The resulting transgenes were recombined with the Df(3R)eIF2D lines to generate Df.eIF2D wild type and the Df.ΔeIF2D mutant lines. To generate eIF2D, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce a single cut in the first exon of eIF2D and used homology directed repair to introduce a 22 bp deletion (see Supplementary Table 2 for guide RNA and homology arm primers). UAS-crc transgenic fly: The main ORF from the crc RA isoform was amplified from w adult cDNA and was cloned into the pUAST plasmid between the EcoRI and XbaI sites. Transgenic flies were generated by injecting this plasmid in w embryos by standard P-element transformation. 50 L1 larvae of the appropriate genotype were picked and placed in a vial containing standard cornmeal molasses media supplemented with yeast paste. Three vials were tested per genotype for a total n of 150. Animals were allowed to mature at 25 °C for 14 days. After 14 days, animals that had not eclosed were transferred to a grape agar plate and allowed to age for an additional 7 days at 25 °C to determine final lethal phase. Bainbridge and Bownes staging criteria was used to determine lethal phases during metamorphosis. Animals of the appropriate genotype and developmental stage were imaged while in the pupal case (for puparium morphology) or dissected out of the pupal case (for pupa morphology). All pupa images were taken on an Olympus SXZ16 stereomicroscope coupled to an Olympus DP72 digital camera with DP2-BSW software. Second instar larvae of each genotype were moved to a new vial containing 4% sucrose as a nutrient source. The number of surviving larvae was counted 8 h later. 4E-BP and ATF4 mRNA levels in surviving larvae were assessed using qPCR. The assays were done in the cn.bw background to eliminate eye pigments. The integrity of the photoreceptors was assessed through green fluorescent pseudopupils as seen by the Rh1-GFP transgene. Live flies for each genotype were monitored over 30 days and data were analyzed by log-rank test using the Kaplan–Meier method to determine significance. Analysis of the contact interface between RNA and PUA domains from several crystallographic structures (PDB 3LWP, 3LWR, and 3HAX), as well as the lower resolution cryoEM structure of human eIF2D bound to tRNA (5OA3) identified over ten PUA amino acid side chains contacting tRNA. We prioritized human D111 since the equivalent amino acid in the PUA domain of the human DKC1 protein has an established human genetic phenotype of causing the disease dyskeratosis congenita, reasoning that this established bioactivity in vivo would make it more likely to have a tRNA-specific expression phenotype in our experimental system. In order to confirm the 3D structural equivalence of Drosophila eIF2D D109 with human eIF2D D111, homology models of the Drosophila eIF2D PUA domain were made using previously described approaches using all of the PUA crystallographic and cryoEM templates and this amino acid side chain superimposed to observe that human D111 and Drosophila D109 occupied the same location in the structure. Fat bodies or eye disks from wandering 3rd instar larvae were dissected in 1× PBS and fixed in 4% PFA, 1× PBS for 20 min. Tissues were then washed 1x with 1× PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-X 100, 1× PBS (PBST) for 20 min. The tissues were stained in PBST with primary antibodies at the indicated dilution and Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:500 for 1.5 h, washed 3× with PBST and mounted with DAPI.

Cell lysates were prepared in 1% NP-40, 1× TBS on ice for 10 min and debris was cleared by centrifuging at 16,000×g for 10 min, 4 °C. Ten larval heads were dissected in 1× PBS and lysed similarly in 100 μl buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche], 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS. Lysates were analyzed on denaturing SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting with primary antibodies at indicated dilutions at 4 °C overnight and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Jackson Immunolabs) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies: Guinea pig anti-eIF2D (1:500, raised against GST-tagged full length recombinant Drosophila eIF2D expressed using pet23a vector), Guinea Pig anti-Drosophila ATF4, Rabbit anti-ATF4 (1:200, SCBT sc-200), Rabbit anti-PeIF2α (1:500, Abcam ab32157), Rabbit anti-eIF2α (1:2000, Abcam ab26197), Mouse anti-actin (1:5000, Millipore), Rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Life Technologies A6455). Larval lysates were prepared from 25 larvae as described above in RNAse-free lysis buffer containing 20U/ml of SUPERase-In RNAse inhibitor (Thermo Fisher). The lysates were incubated with anti-eIF2D antibody (1:100) for 2 h at 4 °C on an end-over-end rotator. 10 μl of Protein A Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher, prewashed 3× with lysis buffer) were added to the antibody:lysate mixture and incubated further for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer and eluted in 20 μl 1% SDS by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Eluates were analyzed on a 15% UREA-TBE gel for nucleic acid species. For the nuclease-sensitivity assay, eluates were diluted tenfold in distilled water and DNase buffer (provided with TURBO DNase kit, Thermofisher). and digested with 1 μl TURBO DNase or RNase I (NEB) for 1 h at 37 °C. Digested eluates were analyzed on 15% UREA-TBE gel. WT and ΔeIF2D HAP1 cells (Horizon Discovery, HZGHC002651c012) were cultured according to supplier’s protocol. Cells were transfected with negative control scrambled siRNA (Qiagen) or DENR siRNA (Dharmacon, L-012614-00-0005) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Human eIF2D (Dharmacon, 4339127) was subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 and cotransfected with siRNA.

The constructs pCMV-HA-VN173-Tubulin and pCMV-HA-VC155-Tubulin were obtained from Dr J. DeLuca (Colorado State University). RREB1 was cloned into pCMV-HA-VC155-Tubulin, SIN3A, KDM1A and HDAC1 were cloned into pCMV-HA-VN173-Tubulin using XhoI and EagI sites and NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly cloning kit following manufacturers’ protocol. For BiFC analysis, 50 ng of pCMV-HA-VC155-RREB1 was transfected into HEK293 cells seeded onto glass-bottom 24-well plate. Following 24 h of transfection, the cells were subsequently transfected with 50 ng of empty vector, pCMV-HA-VN173-SIN3A or pCMV-HA-VN173-HDAC1. pCAG-CFP was used at 20 ng per well as control. Transfection was performed using LipoD293 reagent. Confocal imaging was performed with an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope using 60x/1.4 PlanApo oil-immersion objective and FluoView software. The excitation wavelengths used were 405 nm and 488 nm for CFP and Venus respectively. RREB1 was cloned into pcDNA-BirA plasmid using standard molecular biology and published protocols. HEK293-TREx flp-in cells (Invitrogen/Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) were co-transfected with pOG44 and pcDNA5 FRT/TO FLAG-BirA-RREB1 using the X-tremeGENE9 DNA transfection reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Stable lines were selected in DMEM/10% FBS supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cells were grown to 70% confluency on 5 × 150 mm2 dishes and incubated for 24 h in complete media supplemented with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma) and 50 μM biotin (BioShop). Cells were washed twice with PBS, scrapped from the dish, pelleted by centrifugation (250 × g for 5 min) and snap frozen. For mass spectrometry experiments, pellets were lysed in 10 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1:500 protease inhibitor (Sigma), 250U Turbonuclease (Accelagen) at 4 °C for 1 h and sonicated (30 s, at 35% power, Sonic Dismembrator 500; Fisher Scientific) to disrupt aggregates. Following centrifugation (35,000 × g for 30 min), supernatants were incubated with 30 μl of pre-equilibrated Streptavidin-Sepharose beads (GE) at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation (250xg, 2 min), washed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.2 (six times), and treated with TPCK-trypsin (Promega) for 16 h at 37 °C. The tryptic peptide containing supernatants were collected, lyophilized, suspended in 0.1% formic acid and a aliquot (1/6th the sample) analyzed by mass spectrometry. HEK293 were obtained from ATCC. EBV-transformed lymphocytes were created from mouth swabs at the Centre for Applied Genomics (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were established from E13.5 embryos minced, filtered and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C. EBV-LCL and HEK293T cells were culture in DMEM (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). pLKO.1 lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs targeting RREB1 or a nonspecific sequence (shCon) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells with pPAX2 and pVSVG (Addgene) using the X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche). The virus was collected 48 hours after transfection. HEK293T cells were infected with lentivirus and stable lines were selected in DMEM/10% FBS/200 μg/ml neomycin and considered stable after 6 days growth in selection. HEK293T-REx cells (Invitrogen/Thermofisher) were co-transfected with pOG44 and pcDNA5 FRT/TO FLAG-BirA-RREB1 using the LipoD293 transfection reagent (SignaGen, Rockville, MD). Stable lines were selected in DMEM/10% FBS/200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cellular proliferation assay were performed with 5.0 × 103 cells plated in 96-well plate (n = 8) grown for 24–72 h and treated with Alamar Blue (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Colony assays were conducted with HEK293 cells expressing stable shRNA control or shRNA-RREB1 (5000 cells/ml). Briefly, a suspension of 0.35% agarose in DMEM (4.5 mg/ml glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS in the absence of antibiotic was layered onto a 0.5% agarose/DMEM base layer. Cells were permitted to grow for 7–10 days and plates were photographed. Cellular proliferation was measured using Essen IncuCyte ZOOM system, briefly 5.0 × 103 cells were plated in a 96-well plate (n = 8) and cell confluency monitored over the time course. Transient transfections with siRNA were performed using 1–5 nM siRNA (SiGenome-Dharmacon) and RNAiMAX reagent (TherrmoFisher) according to the manufacture’s protocol for 72 h. ChIP was performed in HEK293-TREx-FLAG-BirA-RREB1 cells or Rreb+/− or WT MEFs using SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit with magnetic beads (Cell Signaling #9003) following the manufacturers’ protocol. Efficacy of ChIP is largely determined by the availability of ChIP grade antibodies which are not available for RREB1. Therefore, we used a tetracycline (Tet) inducible flag-tagged RREB1 in the human cell line HEK293 and the flag moiety for immunoprecipitation. All samples for ChIP were conducted on 3 independent experiments in triplicate. Primers for ChIP were designed using Primer3 software (Supplementary Table 1). For ChIP in murine hearts, hearts were excised and perfused with cold PBS-2mM EDTA until pale. Heart tissue was minced and incubated in DMEM, crosslinked with 2% formaldehyde for 20 min with shaking. Cross-linking was quenched with glycine. Cells were pelleted (280g for 10 min) washed with cold PBS and suspended in DMEM with 0.5 mg/ml Collagenase D (Sigma Aldrich) for 50 min. Following digest, cells were washed and suspended into Buffer B from the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit, sonicated to break up remaining tissue pieces and digested with 0.05% MN as per the SimpleChIP kit. Raw reads were aligned to hg38 using bwa (version 0.7.15) (PMID: 22569178). The resulted sam files are converted to bam with samtools (version 1.8) (PMID: 21245279). MACS2 (version 2.1.1.20160309) (PMID: 18798982) was used to call peak on the bam files. bedGraph files containing signal per million reads produced from MACS2 was converted to bigwig files with ucsc tool kit (315). Selected publicly-available ChIP-seq datasets (GSM803530, GSE91830, GSM803525 and GSE91601) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The results were parsed for genes of interest, the data subsetted and converted to bedGraph format using tools available from the UCSC Genome Browser. Data was imported into R using established packages. Processed ENCODE tracks were filtered for significant peaks based on matched p-value tracks downloaded from the same GEO series for each dataset using p < 0.05, and annotated using ChIPseeker (v1.12.1). For echocardiography measurements, mice were anesthetized (2% isoflurane, 98% oxygen) and body temperature maintained at 37 °C. Echocardiography was performed using a 15-MHz linear ultrasound transducer (Vivid7; GE). LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) mmode measurements were made from short-axis views at the level of the papillary muscle. LVEDD was measured at the time of the apparent maximal LV diastolic dimension, whereas LVESD was measured at the time of the most systolic excursion of the posterior wall. LV fractional shortening (FS) was calculated as follows: FS = (LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD × 100%. Total RNA was isolated from cells with TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. cDNAs were made using the QuantiTect kit (Qiagen). QPCR was performed using an ABI Step One-Plus System with LUNA Universal master mix (NEB). Nuclear extract harvested from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with VC-RREB1 (according to protocol described above) was layered on top of a continuous glycerol gradient (10–60%) in Tris buffer containing NaCl. Following ultracentrifugation at 135,000 g for 18 h at 4 °C, fractions were collected, boiled with sample buffer and run on SDS-PAGE for subsequent western blot analysis. Hearts were dissected from mice and immediately fixed in formalin for 24 h and then placed in 70% ethanol. Cardiac sections from wild type and Rreb1+/− hearts were fixed on microscope slides side by side to facilitate direct comparisons of stained tissue. Standard protocols provided by the STTARR (Spatio-temporal Targeting and Amplification of Radiation Response) facility at University Health Network (UHN) were used for IHC. Cells were plated into 12-well plate at 70–80% confluence. Cells were serum starved in DMEM base media for 8 h and then stimulated with FBS (final concentration 10%), or other factors (final concentration 50 ng/ml). EBV-suspension cells were pelleted to remove growth media, washed with PBS, and serum starved in DMEM base media. Following starvation, 5.0 × 105 cells were collected in Eppendorf tubes and stimulated with FBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (280 × g for 10 s). All signaling reactions were quenched immediately after time points with 250 μl 2X sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 200 mM DTT). Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/western blot using standard protocols. C57BL/6J-Rreb1 mice were made at The Centre for Phenogenomics (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada). All mice received environmental enrichment, animal rooms are maintained at 20–24 °C, 40–65% humidity, and 12 h light/dark cycle. Cas9 endonuclease-mediated cleave was used in C57BL/6 J zygotes obtained from the Canadian Mouse Mutant Repository. Cas9 RNA guided recognition sites as follows (1): CCAGCTGACTACATGGCAAG, (2): CTCGGCTGCAGGAAGTACAC, (3): GAAAACTCGTAGTGGCACAG, (4): CGTTACAACAAAGCACCCTT. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Research Council of the University Health Network (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). All experiments were performed on male mice. The promoter sequences were amplified by PCR with from human gDNA (Roche) and using Q5 High-fidelity 2x Master Mix (New England Biolabs). Full length PCR products were gel purified (Agarose 0.5% w/v), digested with Fermentas FAST digest reagents (Thermo Scientific) and cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) utilizing the NheI/Bgl-II sites. Ligation reactions were conducted with Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche). The Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) was used for promoter activation assays. Briefly, 2.0 × 105 cells were transfected with 100 ng of pGL3-promoter reporter construct and 4 ng of phRL-SV40 (Promega) using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 18 h post transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for firefly and renilla luciferase activity reading on a Glo-Max dual injector luminometer (Promega). Each measurement was made on 3 distinct samples repeated in triplicate. Error bars for Luciferase activity represent standard deviations. Serum starved cells were stimulated with 10% FBS (final concentration) for 1–12 min to activate RAS. Cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed with TX100 buffer (25 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. An aliquot was removed for analysis of total RAS in the whole cell lysate and the remainder incubated with 10ug GST-tagged Raf-binding domain (RBD, gift from Ikura lab). Complexes were immunoprecipitated with magnetic glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich). IPs were washed with TX100 buffer and RAS-GTP eluted by boiling in 2X sample buffer. Transcripts were quantified using STAR (v2.4.2a) and the UCSC genome browser (Feb 2009 assembly, hg38) as the reference and Gencode (v25) for annotation. Differential analysis of quantified read counts from across the samples was facilitated by the DESeq2 (v1.16.1). Transcripts with zero reads mapped across all samples were filtered out prior to downstream analysis. Read counts were collapsed to gene level and transcripts with the highest reads mapped were kept. Lowly-expressed genes were filtered out by applying a minimum sum of at least 10 reads mapped in total per gene across the six samples. Fold changes were generated from the filtered count data matrix, modeled as a function of condition (CON vs. sh-RREB1), and p-values were further adjusted for multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Significant hits were defined as genes with an FDR-adjusted p-value of at least 0.01 and an absolute log2-fold change greater than 1. Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical environment (v3.4.1). Determination of significance for QPCR data was done using Student’s t-test, assuming equal variance, and p-values were calculated based on two-tailed test. Functional gene-annotation enrichment analysis, functional annotation, KEGG pathway mapping analysis of CHIP-seq and RNA-seq was performed using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home). All error bars represent standard deviations calculated with Excel. Box plots indicate the interquartile range (IQR) of the data and the central line shows the median calculated using Displayr (https://www.displayr.com/). Standard protocols were followed. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8–10% gels or 4–20% wedge gels (Sigma Aldrich). All gels were transferred to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS plus 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST). To analyze the nuclear compartment, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mM TRIS pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Nuclear fraction was pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in 2X sample buffer. Blots were exposed on Microchemi-4.2 (DNR Bio-imaging Systems) and quantified with BIO-RAD Quantity One. All uncropped blots are provided in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8. X-rays were performed using the Faxitron UltraFocusDXA machine (Faxitron Bioptics, LLC, Tucson, Arizona, USA) and the Automatic Exposure Control software. High-resolution X-ray images of skulls were acquired at approximately 25 kV for five seconds and 2× magnification.

A total of 213 predialysis CKD patients (aged 18–80 years old) were enrolled in this study (Department of Nephrology of Xinqiao Hospital, Chongqing, China). The pre-established exclusion criteria were diabetes, pregnancy, HIV, polycystic kidney disease, renal cancer, and recent immunosuppressive therapy. The basic information and laboratory parameters including serum inorganic phosphate and eGFR of the enrolled patients were collected. Echocardiograms were performed on the first day of hospitalization using two-dimensional M-mode. EF%, ventricular dimension and wall thickness were detected at end-diastole and end-systole using IE33–5S (Philips Medical System). LVMI was calculated by indexing left ventricular mass to height. Serum samples of three healthy donors and three CKD patients at stage 5 were collected for later experiments. Informed written consent was provided by all participants. All human studies, including collection and use of samples, were approved by the Ethics Committee of Xinqiao Hospital of the Army Medical University (No. 2018-006-01), and the study design and conduct complied with all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants and was conducted in accordance to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study is compliant with the guidance of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for the Review and Approval of Human Genetic Resources. IRF1 knockout mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), which were backcrossed to C57BL/6J background to produce heterozygous IRF1+/− mice. kl/kl mice were provided by Jun Gu (State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, College of Life Science, Peking University, Beijing, China), and the mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J background for more than 6 generations. C57BL/6J and Balb/c mice were purchased from Beijing Huafukang Bioscience (Beijing, China). Male Balb/c, WT C57BL/6J and IRF1+/− mice of 8-week-old were inflicted with 2/3 electrocoagulation of the right renal cortex (the lower and upper thirds of the kidney) and received left total nephrectomy two weeks later to construct 5/6 nephrectomy CKD model, which is in accordance with the clinical manifestations of human ESRD patients and described in multiple reports including our own studies. Mice underwent laparotomy without kidney operation served as a sham group. Then the mice were randomly separated into the following groups and were blinded to the investigators who helped collect samples. (1) Sham and CKD Balb/c mice fed with normal diet for 8 weeks.

Male C57BL/6J mice of 8-week-old without surgery were divided into the following groups. (1) WT and kl/kl mice. (2) WT and IRF1−/− mice. (3) WT and IRF1−/− mice fed with or without HPD for 12 weeks. (4) Control and adenine-induced CKD mice (C57BL/6J mice) fed with a normal diet containing 0.25% adenine (Sigma) or not for 8 weeks. All animals were housed four to five per cage under a 12:12 h light:dark cycle at 25 °C, with a humidity of 40–70%. High-resolution echocardiography was performed under anesthesia, and left ventricular internal diameter at diastole (LVIDd), left ventricular posterior wall thickness at diastole (LVPWd), EF% and short-axis M-mode views were recorded by the Vevo 770 Echocardiography Imaging System (VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada). Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation at appointed times, and the heart weight (HW), body weight (BW), and tibial length (TL) were recorded. Serum phosphate, BUN, and Scr were measured. The hearts were harvested for three parts: (1) perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) staining; (2) fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for TEM observation; (3) froze in liquid nitrogen for qPCR and western blot analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Army Medical University, and were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Committee. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mouse ELISA kits detecting serum intact FGF23, C­terminal FGF23 and PTH were bought from Immutopics (San Clemente, CA, USA). Mouse VitD ELISA kit was obtained from AbebioSience (Wuhan, China). Mouse klotho ELISA kit was acquired from Cusabio (Cologne, Germany). Rat embryonic cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were isolated as we and others previously described. Briefly, the left ventricles of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Beijing Huafukang Bioscience) were collected and digested with trypsin (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at room temperature, and then incubated with 0.1% collagenase II (Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were filtered through a cell strainer (70 μm, BD Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA), and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. Then, the cells were resuspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) for 1 h, and in DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS and 0.1 mM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 48 h. Finally, both NRCMs and H9c2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Intracellular inorganic phosphate in the supernatant of cell lysate was measured using the molybdate blue method with an inorganic phosphate assay kit (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The corresponding protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit (Beyotime). The phosphate level of each sample was normalized against the protein content, and then compared with the control group for a relative intracellular phosphate level. All tissue samples were collected on ice and flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen immediately. Samples were kept in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage, and were reserved in −80 °C refrigerator for short-term use. After isolation using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) method, RNA was kept in 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) water, and the OD260/OD280 of RNA was detected using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Only when the OD260/OD280 of RNA was between 1.8 and 2.0 did the RNA was used for subsequent reverse transcription using a reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green qPCR kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The primers for qPCR are listed in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. Total protein was extracted with cell lysis buffer (Beyotime) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), and the concentration was measured with BCA kit (Beyotime). The proteins were separated with 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (ThermoScientific). The membranes were separately incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and anti-rabbit (A7016) or anti-mouse (A0216) HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Beyotime) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were washed and the signals were visualized with Clarity ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Gray-scale results were normalized against β-actin for semiquantitative analysis. The antibodies against IRF1 (sc-514544x), PPARα (sc-130640), and β-actin (sc-47778) were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). The antibodies against PGC1α (ab54481), Pit1 (ab10545), Pit2 (ab191182), phosphorylated FGFR1 (p-FGFR1, ab59194), total FGFR1 (t-FGFR1, ab824), phosphorylated FGFR4 (p-FGFR4, ab192589), total FGFR4 (t-FGFR4, ab41948), NRF1 (ab175932), and TFAM (ab131607) were obtained from Abcam Biotechnology (Cambridge, MA, USA). All of the antibodies were diluted 1:1000 for western blot. Uncropped and unprocessed scans of all blots are provided in Supplementary Figs. 17–21 in the Supplementary Information. After cell lysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was determined using an ATP Determination Kit from Invitrogen company (A22066) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cellular ATP level was calculated according to the standard curve using an ATP reference standard. The corresponding protein concentration was tested using a BCA kit (Beyotime). ATP level (nmol) was normalized to total protein content (mg). Finally, each sample was compared with the control group for a relative ATP level. After HP treatment, H9c2 cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated with CM-H2DCF-DA at 37 °C for 20 min, and analyzed using Accuri C6 flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). A figure exemplifying the gating strategy is provided in Supplementary Fig. 22. Total DNA, including chromosomal (B2M) and mitochondrial (D-loop) DNA, was extracted from H9c2 cells using a DNA extraction kit (Takara) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was carried out using an SYBR Green qPCR kit (Takara). Chromosomal DNA served as an internal control. The primers are shown in Supplementary Table 5. H9c2 cells were treated with control or HP for 24 h. The cells were incubated with JC-1 at 37 °C for 20 min, washed twice with JC-1 buffer, and placed in the culture medium on ice. Cells were imaged using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany) or harvested for flow cytometry analysis (BD Biosciences). Heart tissues of mice were harvested and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C and post fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were gradiently dehydrated in acetone (50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% separately) and embedded in epoxy resins. The ultrathin section was stained with uranyl acetate/lead citrate for visualization using a TEM (JEM-1400PLUS, Japan). OCR was assessed using the Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Cells were seeded quadruplicately in cell culture microplates (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and treated with control or HP for 24 h. One hour prior to the assay, the culture medium was replaced by base medium (Agilent Technologies) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 10 mM glucose (Agilent Technologies), and then cells were incubated at 37 °C without CO2. After three basal respiration measurements without additives, the ATP synthase inhibitor (1 μM oligomycin) was added, followed by subsequent mitochondrial uncoupler (1 μM FCCP), and complex I and III inhibitors (1 μM rotenone and 1 μM antimycin A), respectively. Three separate measurements were recorded after the reagents (all bought from Agilent Technologies) were injected. After treatment, cardiac cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained with α-actinin (sc-17829, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted 1:50) at 4 °C overnight. After washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (A0568, Beyotime, diluted 1:300) in the dark. Heart tissues were stained with WGA Alexa Fluor™ 555 Conjugate (500 μg/ml, W32464, Thermo Scientific) at room temperature for 10 min and washed with PBS four times. Cells and tissue sections were imaged using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica). Total RNA was extracted from the heart samples of sham and CKD mice for microarray analysis using Affymetrix Clariom S array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), robust multiaverage, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment. Fold change >1.5 and P < 0.05 was defined as differentially expressed. Full-length cDNA sequence of rat IRF1, PGC1α, NRF1, and TFAM was obtained from Pubmed. The corresponding primers, restriction enzymes and vectors are listed in Supplementary Table 6. PCR was performed to obtain the target gene fragments. After digestion, recombination, transformation, culture of the bacteria with recombinant plasmids, and further culture of the positive monoclones, the bacteria were identified by Beijing Genomics Institute (Beijing, China). H9c2 cells were separately transfected with siRNAs (IRF1, Pit1, and Pit2), or overexpression plasmids (IRF1, PGC1α, NRF1, and TFAM) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, cells were treated with HP for another 24 h, and were harvested for the subsequent experiments. Scramble siRNA and siRNAs targeted to IRF1, Pit1, and Pit2 (listed in Supplementary Table 7) were synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China). Putative IRF1 binding sites in the PGC1α promoter region are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Various lengths of the rat PGC1α promoter region were amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of H9c2 cells as a template. The corresponding primers are listed in Supplementary Table 8. The fragments including PGC1α-1703 (−1703 to +188), PGC1α-1524 (−1524 to +188), PGC1α-985 (−985 to +188), PGC1α-719 (−719 to +188), PGC1α-348 (−348 to +188), and PGC1α-183 (−183 to +188) were separately cloned into a pGL3-basic vector (Promega) after digestion with HindIII, and the recombinant reporter plasmids were separately named as pGL3-PGC1α-P6, pGL3-PGC1α-P5, pGL3-PGC1α-P4, pGL3-PGC1α-P3, pGL3-PGC1α-P2, and pGL3-PGC1α-P1. pGL3-PGC1α-M3, containing point mutations in the IRF1 binding element (AATAGGGAGGAGAGGGAAGGA, the mutated bases are underlined), was generated with MutanBEST kit (Takara) using pGL3-PGC1α-P3 (−719 to +188) as a template. Negative control mutation plasmid pGL3-PGC1α-M4, containing point mutations in the IRF1 binding element (ATATAAGAAGGGAGGGGGGGG, the mutated bases are underlined), was also generated, using pGL3-PGC1α-P4 (−985 to +188) as a template. The recombinant reporter plasmids were co-transfected with pRL-TK vector (Promega) into H9c2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM (Hyclone). Then, the cells were treated with control or HP for another 24 h. Luciferase activity was detected using the Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla activity. All transfection experiments were performed three times in triplicate. H9c2 cells were treated with control or HP for 24 h, and then fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were lyzed in SDS lysis buffer. The chromatin was sonicated to shear DNA to an average length between 200 to 1000 bp, and immunoprecipitated with 2 μg antibody against IRF1 (sc-514544x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), taking IgG as a negative control. The precipitated DNA was amplified by PCR and qPCR with the primers (−709 to −511) that cover the IRF1 binding sites (−632 to −612). Primers (−1711 to −1598) without IRF1 binding sites served as a negative control, while the total DNA (Input) served as a positive control. For acetylation detection, the sonicated DNA was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg antibody against H3 (Lys9) (#9671) or H4 (Lys12) (#13944) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), taking IgG as a negative control. The primers for ChIP are listed in Supplementary Table 9. Genomic DNA of H9c2 cells was modified with bisulfate using EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers that recognize the methylated and unmethylated CpG island sites in the IRF1 promoter region were designed by MethPrimer software (http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/) and listed in Supplementary Table 10. The PCR products of genomic DNA without bisulfate modification served as a positive control (Input). All continuous characteristics were plotted by bar charts (means and standard deviations). Comparisons of indicators that follow normal distribution between two groups were analyzed by two independent sample t-test, and that among multiple groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Considering treatment time factors, comparisons of indicators between treatment groups were examined using analysis of variance of factorial design. In the human study, continuous characteristics that obey non-normal distribution were drawn by box plots (medians and interquartiles). Spearman rank correlation was used to analyze the correlation between phosphate levels and eGFR, and partial correlation analyses were performed to examine the associations of EF and LVMI with phosphate levels after controlling eGFR. Kruskal–Wallis H test was used to compare the indicators among three tertiles of the serum phosphate levels. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 8.0 and SPSS 21.0, and all tests were two-tailed with a significant level set at P < 0.05. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
Sequences of oligos used for cloning are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Plasmids for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout were generated by annealing DNA oligos encoding the sgRNA and cloning them into the px459 vector (Addgene 48139) via the two Bbs1 sites. For DENR overexpression, pSS265 from was used. For GFP and ATF4 overexpression, the respective coding sequences were cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 backbone via restriction sites EcoR1(GFP)/HindIII (ATF4) and Nhe1. The Lamin B1 5′UTR firefly and renilla luciferase reporters and the Lamin B1 5′UTR stuORF reporter were previously described. The uORF length reporters (Supplementary Fig. 1e) were generated by oligo cloning the uORF sequences into the Lamin B1 5′UTR renilla luciferase reporter at the Spe1 and Age1 restriction sites. Renilla luciferase reporters with 5′UTRs of various genes (Figs. 2d–f and 3e) were cloned by amplifying the 5′UTR of the gene of interest from HeLa cell cDNA and cloning it into the renilla luciferase reporter plasmid at the HindIII and Bsp119l sites. As the ATF4 5′UTR contains a BSP119l site, a Bsu15l to Bsp119l scar ligation was used for those reporters. Generally, uORFs were extended or deleted (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 4a) by site-directed mutagenesis PCR and cloned back into the original plasmid at the HindIII and BSP119l sites. The ATF4 5′UTR was shortened by PCR amplification of the fragment and insertion via Bsu15l and HindIII (Fig. 3a). Reporters with uORFs in the Lamin B 5′UTR context (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 5a–d) were generated by oligo cloning the uORF sequences into the Lamin B1 5′UTR renilla luciferase reporter at the Spe1 and Age1 restriction sites. The ATF4 5′UTR reporter used in this paper contains the first 364 nucleotides of the ATF4 mRNA (NM_182810.2), which include the 5′UTR (281 nt) and the ATF4 ORF up to the end of uORF3, fused to the Renilla luciferase coding sequence so that the ATF4 mORF is in frame with the Renilla luciferase. Since the transcription start site for all reporters including the normalization control is within the CMV promoter region, all reporters contain an additional 18 nt leader sequence at the 5′ end up to the first available restriction site (gtcagatcactagaagct). HT1080 cells were kindly provided by Stefan Pusch. HeLa (ATCC) cells and HT1080 (ATCC) cells were cultured in DMEM +10% fetal bovine serum +100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco 15140122). Cells were subcultured using Trypsin-EDTA for dissociation. Cellular stress conditions were induced by treatment with tunicamycin at 1 µg/ml, or by amino acid starvation at 2.5% of the normal DMEM amino acid concentration (using dialyzed FBS and amino acid free DMEM), or with sodium arsenite (250 nM). Jurkat (ATCC) cells were cultured in RPMI, 10% FBS, 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco 15140122). For plasmid expression, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were seeded at 700.000 (HeLa controls) or 900.000 (HeLa DENRKO) cells per 10 cm dish and transfected with 6 µg plasmid DNA + 12 µl Lipofectamine reagent. After 5 h, medium was exchanged and after 24 h cells were reseeded for experiments. For the ATF4 overexpression experiment (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 7c), cells were transfected directly in the 96-well format at low cell concentration, since reseeding caused a loss of ATF4 overexpression. For this, Lipofectamine 3000 was used as it causes less cell toxicity: control and DENR KO cells were seeded at 1000 and 1200 cells per well, respectively. On the next day, cells were transfected with 50 ng DNA, 0.1 µl P3000, and 0.075 µl Lipofectamine 3000 per well. Medium was exchanged after 4 h. The proliferation curve was performed by harvesting Plate 0 on the same day, and one plate every successive day, assayed with CellTiter-Glo. For siRNA mediated knockdowns, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAimax. Cells were seeded at 200.000 cells per six-well, transfected with 3 µl 10 µM siRNA and 9 µl Lipofectamine reagent. Cells were reseeded for experiments 48–72 h after transfection. Sequences of siRNAs are provided in Supplementary Table 2. DENR and MCTS1 KO cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Cells were transfected with the pX459 plasmid coding for Cas9, for sgRNAs targeting DENR or MCTS1, and for puromycin resistance. After 24–48 h, transfected cells were selected using 1 µg/ml puromycin for 2–3 days. Then cells were grown out and seeded at limiting dilution and clones were screened for successful knockout by immunoblotting. Successful knockout was then also assessed by sequencing the edited genomic region after PCR amplification and TOPO cloning. Lentiviral plasmids were generated by introducing the following sequences into the Cellecta backbone pRSI21-U6-sh-HTS6-CMV-TagGFP2-2A-Puro by oligo cloning: nontarget shRNA (CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA), two shRNA constructs targeting DENR (shDENR #1: GATGATGACAGCATCGAAGAT; shDENR #2: GAATTAGTGAGGGTCAAGGAA) and two shRNA constructs targeting MCTS1 (shMCTS1 #1: CCCTAAGATTACTTCACAAAT; shMCTS1# 2: TGTACTCAGTGGAGCAAATAT). 293T cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and co-transfected with these plasmids, together with pMD2.G and psPAX2 using Trans IT transfection reagent (MirusBio, MIR 2300). Lentiviruses were harvested 72 h post-transfection and filtered through a 0.45 µm PVDF sterile syringe filter (Carl Roth GmbH, P667.1). For Jurkat cells, 50,000 cells were supplemented with 5 µg/ul of polybrene (Merck Millipore, RT-1003-G) and reverse transduced by spinoculation for 45 min at 800 g and at 32 °C. 7 days post-transduction Jurkat cells were centrifuged for 3 min at 200 × g, washed, and harvested for western blotting. Cells were lysed using standard RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche mini EDTA-free, 1 tablet in 10 ml) and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mM Sodium Ortho-Vanadate, Roche Phosstop 1 tablet in 10 ml, 0.1 M Sodium Fluoride, 0.1 M beta-Glycerophosphate) and Benzonase (50 U/ml), after washing briefly with FBS-free DMEM. Lysates were clarified and protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay. Equal protein amounts were run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane with 0.2-µm pore size. After Ponceau staining membranes were incubated in 5% skim milk PBST for 1 h, briefly rinsed with PBST and then incubated in primary antibody solution (5% BSA PBST or 5% skim milk PBST) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed three times, 15 min each in PBST, incubated in secondary antibody solution (1:10,000 in 5% skim milk PBST) for 1 h at room temperature, then washed again three times for 15 min. Finally, chemiluminescence was detected using ECL reagents and the Biorad chemidoc. No membranes were stripped. Antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 3. For samples treated with Lambda phosphatase, lysis was carried out in Lysis buffer (0,25 M HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 1 M KCl, 5% NP40), without phosphatase inhibitors. After lysates were clarified, 10 µl 10× NEBuffer for Protein Metallo Phosphatases (PMP) was added to 90 µl Lysate and 2 µl NEB Lambda Protein Phosphatase (Lambda PP) was added. Solutions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Then, protein concentration was determined by BCA assay and sample was diluted in 5× Laemmli buffer and boiled. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol following manufacturer’s protocol. To synthesize cDNA, 1 µg of total RNA was used for oligo dT primed reverse-transcription using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase. Quantitative RT-PCR was done with Maxima SYBR Green/ROX mix on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. Actin B was used as a normalization control and all samples were run in technical triplicates. Sequences of Q-RT-PCR oligos used in this study are in Supplementary Table 4. Translation reporter assays after siRNA mediated knockdowns were carried out as follows: Cells were transfected with siRNAs as described above. After 72 h of transfection, cells were reseeded into a 96-well plate. HeLa control cells were seeded at 8.000 cells per well, DENRKO cells were seeded at 12.000 cells per well. Cell were transfected 16–20 h after reseeding using Lipofectamine 2000. In total, 100 ng of renilla luciferase plasmid and 100 ng of firefly luciferase plasmid was used per well. After 4 h of transfection, the medium was exchanged. For translation reporter assays including a DENR reconstitution condition, HeLa control cells were seeded at 8.000 cells per 96-well, while DENRKO HeLa cells were seeded at 12.000 cells per 96-well. After 16–20 h of seeding, these cells were transfected with three plasmids using lipofectamine 2000. Per well, 60 ng of either GFP or DENR expression plasmid, 70 ng of renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, and 70 ng of firefly reporter plasmid were used. After 4 h of transfection, the medium was exchanged. Renilla luciferase plasmids always contained the 5′UTR of interest, while the firefly luciferase plasmid always contained the DENR-independent Lamin B1 5′UTR and was used as a transfection normalization control. A total of 0.4 µl Lipofectamine reagent was used per 96-well. Cells were always transfected in triplicates. After 16–20 h of transfection, luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System by Promega according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HeLa control and DENRKO cells were seeded in 15 cm dishes at 3 million cells per dish in 20 ml growth medium. Two days later, cells were harvested for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq. For RNA-seq, cells were lysed with TRIzol and total RNA was isolated following manufacturer’s protocol. For Ribo-seq, cells were briefly rinsed with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mM MgCl2, 400 μM cycloheximide (CHX). This solution was poured off, removed by gently tapping the dish onto paper towels, and cells were lysed with 150 µl of lysis buffer (0.25 M HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 1 M KCl, 5% NP40, 1000 μM CHX) per plate. Cells were scraped off and lysate was collected. After brief vortexing, lysate was clarified by centrifuging for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Approximate RNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop system and 100 U of Ambion RNAse 1 was added per 120 µg of measured RNA. To prepare undigested polysome profiles (Supplementary Fig. 3b), RNAse was simply omitted. Lysates were incubated with RNAse for 5 min on ice. Lysates were then pipetted onto 17.5–50% sucrose gradients, which were produced by freezing and layering 50% (2.5 ml), 41.9% (2.5 ml), 33.8% (2.5 ml), 25.6% (2.5 ml), and 17.5% (1.8 ml) sucrose solutions (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 140 mM KCl, 200 µM CHX) in Seton Scientific Polyclear Tubes 9/16 × 3-3/4 IN, and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3.5 h in Beckmann SW40 rotor. Gradients were fractionated using a Biocomp Gradient Profiler system and 80S fractions were collected for footprint isolation. RNA was isolated from these fractions using Acid-Phenol extraction and analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer system to asses RNA integrity. This method was performed as described in ref. . Two days before cell harvest, HeLa cells were seeded at 3 million cells per 15 cm dish in 20 ml growth medium. After brief washing, freshly prepared crosslinking solution (1× PBS, 10 mM MgCl2, 400 µM Cycloheximide, 0.025% PFA, 0.5 mM DSP) was added to the cells. Cells were incubated with crosslinking solution for 15 min at room temperature while slowly rocking. Crosslinking solution was then poured off and remaining crosslinker was inactivated for 5 min with ice-cold quenching solution (1× PBS, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 µM Cycloheximide, 300 mM Glycine). Quenching solution was poured off and 150 µl of lysis buffer (0.25 M HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 1 M KCl, 5% NP40, 1000 μM CHX) was added to each 15 cm dish. Lysis was carried out at 4 °C. Cells were scraped off the dish and lysate was collected. After brief vortexing, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and approximate RNA concentration was determined using a Nanodrop photo-spectrometer. Overall, 100 U of Ambion RNAse 1 was added per 120 µg of measured RNA. Lysates were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C and then loaded onto 17.5–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 5 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge in the SW40 rotor. Gradients were fractionated using a Biocomp Gradient Profiler system. 40S and 80S fractions were collected for immunoprecipitation and footprint isolation. 40S and 80S fractions corresponding to roughly one or two 15 cm dishes were used for direct extraction of RNA for total footprint samples. Footprint fractions were then subjected to crosslink removal and RNA extraction: 55 µl (1/9th of volume) of crosslink-removal solution (10% SDS, 100 mM EDTA, 50 mM DTT) was added, 600 µl Acid-Phenol Chloroform (Ambion) was added and mixture was incubated at 65 °C, 1300 rpm shaking for 45 min. Tubes were then placed on ice for 5 min, spun for 5 min at 20,000 × g and supernatant was washed once with acid-phenol chloroform and twice with chloroform, then RNA was precipitated with Isopropanol and subjected to library preparation (see below). The organic phase was used to isolate the precipitated or total proteins. In total, 300 µl ethanol were added, then 1.5 ml isopropanol were added and solutions were incubated at −20 °C for 1 h. Proteins were sedimented by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, washed twice with 95% ethanol 0.3 M guanidine HCl, dried and resuspended in 1× Laemmli buffer. For 80S footprinting and RNA-seq libraries were prepared as follows: RNA samples were depleted of ribosomal RNA using the Illumina Ribo-Zero Gold kit. Depleted total RNA was then fragmented using chemical cleavage in 50 mM NaHCO3 at pH 10, 95 °C for 12 min. Then total RNA was processed in parallel with the depleted RNA from 80S ribosome fractions. For size selection, RNA was run on 15% Urea-Polyacrylamide gels and fragments from 25 to 35 nt were excised using reference ssRNA nucleotides of 25 and 35 bp run on a neighboring lane. RNA was extracted from the gel pieces and phosphorylated using T4 PNK. Deep-sequencing libraries were prepared from these RNA fragments using the Bio-Scientific NEXTflex Small RNA-Seq Kit v3. DNA was amplified with nine PCR cycles for the Ribo-seq samples and 11–13 cycles for the RNA-seq samples. Deep-sequencing libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Next-Seq 550 system. 40S footprinting libraries were prepared as follows: After RNA extraction from 40S fractions, RNA quality and integrity were determined on an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the total RNA Nano 6000 Chip. For size selection, RNA was run on 15% Urea-Polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and fragments of size 20–80 nt were excised using the Agilent small RNA ladder as a reference. RNA was extracted from the gel pieces by smashing the gels into small pieces with gel smasher tubes and extracting the RNA in 0.5 ml of 10 mM Tris pH 7 at 70 °C for 10 min. Gel pieces were removed and RNA was precipitated using Isopropanol. Footprints were then dephosphorylated using T4 PNK (NEB) for 2 h at 37 °C in PNK buffer without ATP. Footprints were then again precipitated and purified using isopropanol. Footprints were then assayed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer small RNA chip and Qubit smRNA kit. Overall, 25 ng or less of footprint RNA was used as input for library preparation with SMARTer smRNA-Seq Kit for Illumina from Takara/Clontech Laboratories according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Deep-sequencing libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Next-Seq 550 system. Analysis of ribosome footprinting NGS data: adapter sequences and randomized nucleotides were trimmed from raw reads using cutadapt (10.14806/ej.17.1.200). Ribosomal RNA and tRNA reads were removed by alignment to human tRNA and rRNA sequences using bowtie2. Then, the remaining reads were separately aligned to the human transcriptome (Ensembl transcript assembly 94) and human genome (hg38) using BBmap (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). Generally, counted reads were normalized to sequencing depth (number of alignments per library). Read counting, metagene plots (Figs. 1a, b, 4a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b) and single transcript traces (Fig. 1d, f and Supplementary Figs. 2e, h, i, 4c, d) were carried out or created with custom software written in C available on GitHub (https://github.com/aurelioteleman/Teleman-Lab). TE was calculated from the number of 80S ribosome footprints in a coding sequence divided by the number of RNA sequencing reads on the transcript. uORFs were annotated by the presence of an ATG and an in-frame stop codon inside the 5′UTR of any mRNA. Only ATG-initiated uORFs were considered. For Fig. 1c, changes in TE were calculated as . Theoretical Z vs. Observed Z analysis was carried out to determine transcripts with changes in TE higher than expected from gaussian distribution. For the final presentation of the data in Fig. 1c, only the most strongly affected transcript variant of each gene was considered. GO enrichment analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2d) was carried out using the list of downregulated mRNAs from the Z vs. Z analysis and a list of all detected mRNAs as a background list using the Panther GO enrichment analysis platform. For Fig. 1e, groups containing uORFs of certain lengths are nonexclusive, therefore each transcript can be part of multiple groups. Each individual transcript variant for each gene was assigned to groups. Transcripts containing 1AA uORFs were excluded from all other uORF groups to ensure that reduction in TE in these groups was not due to 1AA uORFs. Multiple mapping of ribosome footprints was allowed to account for transcript variants. Statistically significant differences between mRNA groups were assessed by nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test corrected for multiple comparisons. For Supplementary Figure 2c, human orthologs of mouse genes were determined by conversion of mouse gene ID to the human orthologue via the NCBI Homologene database. DENR dependence of ribosome recycling on individual stop codons from 40 S footprinting data was calculated as follows: The number of footprints in a 10 nt window at the stop codon peak was counted, normalized to sequencing depth and the log2(FC) in reads in this area between DENR KO and WT cells was calculated. The log2(FC) was averaged between the two DENR KO cell lines and then a Z-Score analysis was used to classify stop codons into DENR-dependent versus independent. The frequency of terminal codons in DENR-dependent stop codons was compared to the frequency in all detected stop codons to determine codon enrichments () (Fig. 4e, f and Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). Statistical significance of enrichments was assessed using binomial testing. P values were adjusted for multiple testing (61 tests, one for each amino acid coding codon). uORFs were classified as potentially translated when 80S ribosome footprints were detected in a 10 nt window on the putative start codon peak. Penultimate codon enrichments in translated uORFs present in the list of 517 DENR-targets (Supplementary Fig. 5e) were then calculated and statistically assessed as described above. The potential effect on translation efficiency by each uORF penultimate codon (Supplementary Fig. 5f) was calculated by assigning the log2FC(TE) of each transcript to all potentially translated uORFs on that transcript. For luciferase assays, statistically significant differences were determined using nonparametric, unpaired, two-sided t-tests. For immunoblots, all band quantifications shown in the figures are normalized to loading controls. DENR, MCTS1 mRNA expression, and ASNS mRNA expression of ATF4 target signature mRNA expression data from TCGA was downloaded from the UCSC Xena browser (10.1101/326470). Spearman correlation coefficients and significance were calculated in Graphpad Prism.

This study was conducted under the approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols in University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA). The IRB Protocol number at UAB was #N151013001. Clinical glioma specimens and normal brain tissue samples were collected in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at UAB (sample 1005, 1014, 1020, 1027, 1037, 1051, 1079), UCLA (sample 157, 336, 339, 374, 408), MDA (sample 267, 20, 28, 711), and processed at the research laboratories after de-identification of the samples. Freshly resected GBM samples were dissociated and neurosphere cultures were established and cultivated in DMEM/F12 medium containing 2% B27 supplement, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution, 2.5 μg/ml heparin, 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF). bFGF and EGF were added twice a week and the cultural medium was changed every 7 days. The data with neurospheres were obtained with cells cultivated for no longer than 40 passages. The cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. mRNA was isolated by Trizol (Thermo scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo scientific). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by using iScript reverse transcription supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR was performed on StepOnePlus thermal cycler (Thermo scientific) with SYBR Select Master Mix (Thermo scientific). Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C 30 s. Primer specificity was confirmed by visualizing DNA on an agarose gel following PCR. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Data 5. For the apoptosis assay cells were stained with CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Thermo scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After staining samples were analyzed by Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo scientific) with Attune NxT version 4.2 software. Data were processed with FlowJo version 10 software. The samples were gated by FSC-H and SSC-H to distinguish cells from debris (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing 1% protease and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were precleaned by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein lysates (10 μg/lane) were fractionated by NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein gel (Thermo scientific) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Thermo scientific). Subsequently, the membrane was blocked with 5% Blotting Grade Blocker Non Fat Dry Milk (Bio-Rad) for 1 h, incubated with corresponding primary antibody overnight and then incubated with peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 1 h. Staining was visualized with Amersham ECL Western Blot System (GE Healthcare). Unprocessed films for each western blot are provided in Supplementary Fig. 9b. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X, blocked with serum-free protein block solution (Dako) and incubated with corresponding primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, cells were incubated with Alexa Flour-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured on Nikon A1 confocal microscope using NIS-Elements version 4.00 software. Tumors embedded in paraffin blocks were deparaffinized, and hydrated through an ethanol series. After microwave antigen retrieval in DakoCytomation target retrieval solution pH 6 (Dako), slides were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution in methanol for 15 min at room temperature to inhibit internal peroxidase activity. Next samples were blocked with serum-free protein block solution (Dako) and incubated with corresponding primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The next day slides were stained with EnVision+ System—HRP labeled Polymer (Dako) and visualized with DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Signals were detected using Olympus DP71 microscope. Viability of GBM cells was determined using AlamarBlue reagent (Thermo scientific). Cells were seeded at 3000 cells per well in a 96-well plate, after indicated period of time AlamarBlue reagent was added into each well and 6 h later fluorescence was measured (Excitation 515–565 nm, Emission 570–610 nm) using a Synergy HTX multi-mode reader (BioTek). Wound healing (scratch) assay was performed according to the standard protocol. Briefly, glioma spheres were dissociated into single cells and plated on a laminin coated 6-well plate at 1.5 × 106 cells per well. The following day, cell cultures were scratched using a pipette tip. Forty-eight hours later, cells were visualized by light microscopy. These assays were performed three times. The animals (postnatal P7) were rapidly sacrificed, the head briefly placed in 70% ethanol and the brains dissected. Under aseptic conditions, 350 μm-thick whole-brain (sagittal or coronal) sections are cut and collected in sterile medium. One-thousand fifty-one edge sphere cells (stained with PKH67 Green Fluo (Sigma) were seeded on the brain slices (105 cells) along with 5 μl matrix gel. Brain slices were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 days. Next, the slices were fixed for 8 h at 4 °C in 4% PFA and stained for collagen4 and with anti-rabbit Alexa555 second antibody. Images and videos were captured with a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. Female SCID mice aged 6–8-weeks were used for intracranial implantation of GBM cells. All animal experiments were carried out under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol according to NIH guidelines. The mice were housed in groups of five animals per cage and had access to autoclaved water and pelleted feed. The cage environment was enriched with a mouse house. The mice were kept at a standard temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 55% (45–70%) in a 12:12-hour light:dark cycle (lights on, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.). The GBM cells suspension (2 × 105 cells in 3 μl of PBS) was injected into the brains of SCID mice as previously described. When neuropathological symptoms developed, mice were sacrificed and perfused with ice-cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Mice brains were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and then transferred to 10% formalin. AR42 (Arno Therapeutics) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide for in vitro treatments or in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Dow Chemical Company)/0.1% Tween-80 (Sigma) for in vivo administration via oral gavage. On day 10 after injection of GBM cells, mice were administrated with AR42 for 9 days (three times per week, total 3 weeks), and Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated. Lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA for HDAC1 or CD109 were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid DNA was purified with HiSpeed Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen). For lentiviral production, HEK293FT cells were transfected with the vectors (Sigma) and two packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMGD2) using the CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The lentiviral particles were harvested 72 h after transfection and were concentrated 100-fold using a Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech) and stocked −80 °C until infection. One day before infection GBM spheres were dissociated into single cells with accutase and seeded on laminin 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells per well. Next day GBM cells were incubated with viral supernatants for 24 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (EMD Millipore). At 24 h after infection, medium was renewed and cells were collected at 5 days after infection. Cells were lysed with Lysis Buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysis was pre-washed with magnetic beads under 4 °C for 1 h. Then incubate with target antibody at 4 °C overnight. The next day, magnetic beads were added to the antigen sample/antibody mixture and incubated under room temperature for 1 h. One-hundred microliters low-pH elution buffer was used to elute the binding protein. The pH was normalized with 15 μl of neutralization buffer for each 100 μl of elution buffer. IP samples were separated by electrophoresis in 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gel. The ChIP assay was performed after cross-linking cells using formaldehyde. DNA was sonicated using an Ultrasonic Processor (Bioruptor UCD-200) at 12 cycles of 30 s with 30 s interval between cycles. Sonicated DNA was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant was used for ChIP assay using MAGnify ChIP system (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of mouse IgG, HDAC1 (Abcam-ab15050), H3ac (active motif 39139), C/EBPβ (Genetex GTX100675) was used per ChIP. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR, and Ct values were used to calculate the percentage of input enrichment. Re-ChIP was performed using a kit from Active Motif (cat.no.53016) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of sCD109 was measured using the CD109 ELISA kit (LSbio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To monitor tumor growth in live animals, GBM spheres were transduced with lentiviral particles (pHAGE PGK-GFP-IRES-LUC-W) for co-expressesion of GFP and luciferase, and then GFP expressing cells were sorted by FACS. GBM spheres expressing luciferase were intracranially transplanted into immunocompromised SCID mice. To examine the tumor growth, animals were administrated intraperitoneally with 2.5 mg/100 µl solution of XenoLight D-luciferin (PerkinElmer) and anesthetized with isoflurane during the imaging analysis. The tumor luciferase images were captured by using an IVIS100 imaging system (PerkinElmer). Briefly, cDNA libraries for paired-end sequencing were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were sequenced with an llumina HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina) and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Sequence reads in fastq format were imported into a local instance of galaxy (galaxy.uabgrid.uab.edu). STAR (version 2.5.3a) was used to align the raw RNA-Seq fastq reads to the human reference genome from Gencode (GRCh38 Release 25). Cufflinks was then used on the aligned reads from STAR to assemble transcripts, estimate their abundances and test for differential expression and regulation. Cuffmerge, which is part of Cufflinks, merged the assembled transcripts to a reference annotation and is capable of tracking Cufflinks transcripts across multiple experiments. Finally, Cuffdiff was used for statistical examination of the data. Heatmap and clustering were performed with Cluster 3.0 software, with results displayed using Java Treeview software. Single-cell RNA sequencing data were downloaded from http://www.gbmseq.org/. Gene Enrichment Analysis was performed using available online software (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp). ssGSEA (single-sample GSEA) was applied to determine the IVY regional gene-set enrichment score of paired patient GBM samples. PCA was created with SPSS 22.0. Eight milliliters of cell culture media were concentrated and exchanged in PBS using Amicon Ultra 4 ml 3 kDa NMWL centrifugal unit (Millipore). Approximately 40 μg of protein per sample were then diluted to 35 μl using NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were reduced with DTT and denatured at 70 °C for 10 min prior to loading onto Novex NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris Protein gels (Invitrogen). The gels were stained overnight with Novex Colloidal Blue Staining kit (Invitrogen). Following de-staining, each lane was cut into six MW fractions and equilibrated in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, each gel plug was then digested overnight with Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade (Promega) following manufacturer’s protocol. Peptide extracts were reconstituted in 0.1% Formic Acid/ddH2O at 0.1 μg/μl and used for LC-MS/MS analysis. All data are presented as mean ± SD. The number of replicates for each experiment is stated in the figure legend and always refer to independent biological replicates. Statistical differences between two groups were evaluated by two-tailed t-test. One-way ANOVA was utilized in comparisons of >2 groups, following Dunnett’s Tukey’s post-test. The statistical significance of Kaplan–Meier survival plot was determined by log-rank analysis. A statistical correlation was performed to calculate the regression R2 value and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Statistical analysis was performed by Prism 6 (Graphpad Software), unless mentioned otherwise in figure legend. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Exact p-values are provided in Supplementary Data 6. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
Seawater (~200 L) at 0, 2000, 4000, and 8000 m was collected from the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench (11°21.847’N, 142°20.775’E) aboard the R/V Dong Fang Hong 2 in March 2017. Seawater was filtered serially through 3 μm (TSTP, 142 mm, Millipore) and 0.22 μm (GTTP, 142 mm, Millipore) polycarbonate membranes. All filters were stored in liquid nitrogen on board, and at −80 °C in the laboratory. The communities collected on the 3 and 0.22 μm filters were designated as PA and FL fractions, respectively. Metagenome samples at 0, 4000, 9600, 10,400, and 10,500 m were treated in the same way as our previous study. Values calculated for gene abundance at 0 and 4000 m were the mean of two replicates from different cruises but the same station (September 2016 and March 2017). Replicates from 2000 and 8000 m were taken on the same cruise (March 2017). The deep surface sediment samples (~10,910 m) were collected from the Mariana Trench (11°19.5132’N, 142°11.2906’E) during research cruise TS-03 in March 2017, using the lander “TianYaHao”. Sediments at 5525, 6980, 7110, 7670, and 8638 m were collected from the Mariana Trench using a box corer in July 2016. Detailed location information is shown in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1. Water samples used for picoplankton abundance analysis were collected at depths of 4, 100, 200, 454, 868, 2286, 4000, 6264, and 8267 m from the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench (11°20.285’N, 142°23.964’E) aboard the R/V Dong Fang Hong 2 in November 2017. Water samples (2 ml) were immediately fixed with paraformaldehyde (final concentration 1%, v/v) for 1 h in the dark at room temperature and then stored in liquid nitrogen on board. The abundances of Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, picoeukaryotes, and heterotrophic bacteria were measured with a BD FACSJazz flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, USA) in the laboratory. DNA was extracted from water samples as previously described using phenol–chloroform extraction method. Sedimental DNA at depths of 5525–10,911 m was isolated following the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen). RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Sigma) and cleaned using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). DNA was removed using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Successful DNA removal was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene PCR. Water and sediment DNA was sent to Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Primers 515F and 806R (Supplementary Table 7) were used to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Miseq PE300 platform (MiSeq Reagent Kit v3). Water DNA samples at 0, 2000, 4000, and 8000 m, except for the PA fraction of 2000 and 8000 m due to an insufficient quantity of DNA, were sent to Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) for metagenomic sequencing. Libraries were prepared without any amplification step for each sample. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq X-Ten platform, with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads. The abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was quantified using qPCR, with primers Eub338F and Eub518R (Supplementary Table 7). Primers used for quantifying genes involved in DMSP synthesis and degradation are listed in Supplementary Table 7. The construction of qPCR standards and the qPCR assay was performed as described in a previous study. For reverse-transcription qPCR, 9 µl of purified RNA was mixed with 1 µl random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). The reaction system was incubated at 70 °C for 5 min and cooled on ice, before mixing with 1 µl dNTPs (10 mM), 4 µl of M-MLV RT 5× buffer (Promega), 0.8 µl of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), 0.4 µl of RNase inhibitor (40 U µl−1, Roche), and 3.8 µl of Diethyl Pyrocarbonate (DEPC) water. This was then incubated at 42 °C for 1 h and the obtained cDNA was stored at −80 °C. To study the diversity of dsyB and mmtN in sediment, clone library sequencing was performed using their respective degenerate primers (Supplementary Table 7) on sediment from 5525, 6980, 8638, 10,908, and 10,909 m deep. This was instead of the metagenomic sequencing performed on water samples, as there was not enough material. The clone library construction method followed a procedure similar to that described in Yin et al.. Briefly, the PCR amplicon products were inserted in the pUCm-T vector and transformed into Escherichia
coli JM109 competent cells (purchased from Beijing Biomed Genetic Technology Co., Ltd). Positive clones were picked and sequenced. The dsyB OTUs were determined with a nucleotide similarity of 80% by Mothur. Representative sequences of each OTU were translated into protein sequences and were used for phylogenetic tree construction. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were processed with the pipeline of UPARSE. OTUs were clustered at a 97% similarity level. For metagenome sequencing, filtered reads assembly, gene prediction and annotation, and gene abundance calculations were performed as described in our previous study. To identify DMSP production and degradation genes, alignments of ratified sequences of all genes of interest (listed in Supplementary Table 5) were used to build HiddenMarkov Model (HMM) profiles to perform HMM searches as described in Curson et al.. Predicted DMSP cycling proteins with an E-value of ≤10−50 were kept and placed into phylogenetic trees, to determine other potential functional homologs. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA version 7.0 and included non-functional sequences used as outgroups. Sequences that clustered with non-functional sequences were removed and the rest were further analyzed by BLASTp searches against the RefSeq database at NCBI, followed by manual annotation to verify that the top hits were the target protein. To account for variation in bacterial cell numbers between samples, the percentage of bacteria harboring dsyB was normalized to the total microbial community using the single-copy housekeeping gene recA, assuming one copy of dsyB per cell. The HMM profile for RecA was downloaded from FunGene (http://fungene.cme.msu.edu/) and sequences with an E-value of ≤10−50 were retained. The percentage of cells containing a particular gene of interest was calculated as (gene homologs × 100)/recA. The annotation of DMSP-related sequences was performed using BLASTp with an E-value cutoff of 10−5 against NCBI-nr databases for taxonomic analysis and only the best hits were retained. Taxonomy assignment was performed in MEGAN software based on the BLAST results of the nr database using the lowest common ancestor algorithm. Reads of different water depths were analyzed for metagenomic binning separately with the metaWRAP-Assembly module using MegaHit (version 1.1.2). Metagenomics binning software MaxBin2 (version 2.2.4), metaBAT2 (version 2.12.1), and CONCOCT (version 0.4.0) were used to produce three MAGs. These were consolidated into a single, stronger MAG, which was further improved with reassembly using Reassemble_bins. Completeness and contamination of MAGs were assessed using CheckM, and MAGs with a completeness > 50% and contamination < 10% were considered. Taxonomy of each bin was determined by CheckM, further confirmed by Taxator-tk (version 1.3.3e). DMSP-related gene sequences (Supplementary Table 5) were used as query sequences to perform BLASTp against MAGs sequences. An identity value of 40% and coverage of 70% were used as thresholds to capture the functional proteins. Seawater samples were collected from Challenger Deep (0, 50, 100, 120, 150, 200, 6050, and 8320 m) in March 2017 and (500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 10,400 m) in September 2016. To measure DMSP content, 10 ml seawater was put into 15 ml tubes and 100 μl 50% H2SO4 was added to remove pre-existing DMS and preserve DMSP for later analysis. For the September 2016 cruise, these samples were put at room temperature for at least 1 h and then stored at −20 °C while on board. For the March 2017 cruise, samples were stored at 4 °C. When samples were brought to the laboratory, those stored at −20 °C were thawed overnight at room temperature. To cleave DMSP into DMS, 2 ml seawater was put into 10 ml vials and mixed with 200 μl NaOH (10 M), and crimp sealed. Due to this non-standard procedure of sample storage, we tested whether freezing DMSP and DMS samples in seawater with H2SO4 overestimates DMSP, due to the inhibition of DMS oxidation. Three fresh seawater samples collected from Luxun Park in Qingdao (Shandong, China) were halved and H2SO4 was added to both halves. One was stored at room temperature and another was frozen at −20 °C. We found that this freezing process did not lead to an overestimation of DMSP (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, it is possible that a portion (<1 nM) of the seawater DMSP measured in this study may not be actually DMSP but some other organic sulfur compound that produces DMS upon alkaline hydrolysis. For sediment samples, 0.1 g sediment was placed into 2 ml vials,and 100 μl water and 100 μl NaOH (10 M) were added before crimp sealing. Reactions were stored in the dark for 24 h. The DMS released was quantified by a purge-and-trap gas chromatography (GC) system or GC auto-injection, respectively, using a flame photometric detector (Agilent 7890B GC fitted with a 7693A autosampler) and an HP-INNOWax 30 m × 0.320 mm capillary column (Agilent Technologies J&W Scientific). All assays were carried out in triplicates. The concentrations of DMS in the seawater were measured immediately after collection on board, using a purge-and-trap GC system. For Chl-a analysis, seawater samples were filtered through a 47 mm Whatman GF/F filter immediately after collection on board. The filters were subsequently stored at −20 °C. When samples were brought to the laboratory, the filters were soaked in 90% acetone in the dark, overnight, to extract Chl-a. After centrifugation, a F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) was used to determine the Chl-a concentration. A total of 210 single colonies isolated from different water depths of Challenger Deep were purified and tested for DMSP production. Bacterial isolates were cultivated in Marine Broth (MB) medium (per liter seawater: 1 g yeast extract, 5 g peptone, 0.01 g ferric phosphate pH 7.6) for 24 h. To determine DMSP content by alkaline lysis, 200 μl of culture and 100 μl of NaOH (10 M) were mixed in 2 ml vials. Vials were crimped immediately, incubated at room temperature overnight in the dark and headspace monitored by GC. Isolates possessing a DMS peak were retained to perform secondary screening. These isolates were cultivated in marine basal medium (MBM) minimal medium (salinity 35 PSU) supplemented with a mixed carbon source (10 mM from a 1 M stock of 200 mM succinate, glucose, pyruvate, sucrose, and glycerol). Hereafter, this medium with the above ingredients was designated as MBM medium. We cultivated bacteria in triplicate under two conditions (i.e., adding 0.5 mM l-Met supplied with 10 mM NH4Cl as a nitrogen source, and no l-Met added with lower nitrogen levels of 0.5 mM NH4Cl). After 24 h, 200 μl of culture (in triplicate) was added to 2 ml vials and was used to test for the presence of DMS directly by GC. In parallel, another 200 μl of culture was added to 2 ml vials and mixed with 100 μl 10 M NaOH (in triplicate). The latter vials were incubated at room temperature for overnight in the dark and the DMS was detected by GC. The emission of DMS after alkaline hydrolysis minus the DMS detected before alkaline hydrolysis was considered to be DMSP production. All 210 bacterial isolates were also screened for DMSP-dependent DMS production. For this, isolates were grown in vials containing 200 μl MBM supplemented with 1 mM DMSP for 24 h, alongside appropriate controls. The DMS in the headspace was quantified as above. To establish whether the DMSP-producing bacteria harbored dsyB and/or mmtN, their genomic DNA was used in PCR with their degenerate primers to these DMSP synthesis genes (Supplementary Table 7). The PCR system and amplification conditions were the same as in Williams et al.. Triplicate cultures of the isolates (100 μl, OD600 = 1.0) were added to 2 ml MBM medium with lowered nitrogen levels (0.5 mM NH4Cl) and no l-Met added. They were incubated at 4 °C, 60 MPa for 35 days. High-pressure incubations were conducted in stainless steel reactors (380 ml, maximum pressure 60 MPa; Nantong Feiyu Oil Science and Technology Exploitation, China). Pressure was delivered by water using a manual pump. To quantify DMSP, once the incubation was finished, 200 μl of culture (in triplicate) was added to 2 ml vials and was used to test for the presence of DMSP by GC as described above. P. nanhaiensis ZYF240 and L. aggregata ZYF612 were isolated from 8000 and 9600 m seawater of the Mariana Trench, respectively. Another two surface seawater strains J526 (P. bermudensis, purchased from DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH) and La6 (Marinibacterium sp. provided by Professor Colin Murrell of University of East Anglia) were also used in this experiment. These were incubated in MBM medium with reduced nitrogen (0.5 mM NH4Cl) and no added methylated sulfur compounds under different pressure conditions, i.e., 0.1, 10, 20, 30, and 40 MPa at room temperature for 4 weeks. After incubation, DMSP production was determined by GC as described above. As high pressures may reduce bacterial growth, DMSP production was normalized to CFUs. Bacterial colonies were counted by spreading serially diluted cultures on Marine Agar (MA) plates. All assays were performed in triplicate. dsyB− mutant and complemented strains of the DMSP producers J526 (P. bermudensis) and La6 (Marinibacterium sp.) were used to investigate whether DMSP production provides protection against high pressure. The dsyB in-frame deletion mutant of a J526 RifR-derivative strain was constructed by a double-crossover allelic exchange, using the suicide vector pK18mobsacB. The primers used are shown in Supplementary Table 7. To construct the ΔdsyB mutant of J562 RifR, two primer pairs (J526-DdsyB-UO/UI and J526-DdsyB-DI/UO) were used to amplify the dsyB upstream and downstream fragments, respectively. Both fragments were purified and fused in a subsequent PCR reaction using primers J526-DdsyB-UO and J526-DdsyB-DO. The fused segment was cloned into the suicide vector pK18mobsacB, transformed into E. coli 803, and mobilized into J562 RifR by triparental mating, using the helper plasmid pRK2013, as in Curson et al.. The transconjugants with a single-crossover insertion in the chromosome were obtained by screening on MA with rifampicin (20 μg/ml) and kanamycin (20 μg/ml). Allelic exchange between the chromosomal gene and the mutagenized plasmatic copy was achieved in a second crossover event, which was counter-selected on MA containing 10% (w/v) sucrose to cause the excision of the suicide vector from the chromosome. The resultant ΔdsyB mutant of J562 RifR was selected by kanamycin (20 μg/ml) sensitivity and was confirmed by PCR, sequencing, and by the loss of DMSP production. The ΔdsyB mutant of La6 RifR was constructed in the same way, using La6-specific primers (Supplementary Table 7). Genetic complementation was performed using cloned dsyB from L. aggregata IAM12614 in the expression vector pLMB509-GFP, confirmed to be functional by Curson et al.. Cloned dsyB was mobilized into ΔdsyB mutants by triparental mating with the helper plasmid pRK2013, as in Curson et al.. The transconjugants were obtained on MA with rifampicin (20 μg/ml) and gentamycin (20 μg/ml), and the complemented strains of ΔdsyB mutants were confirmed by PCR, sequencing, and phenotype of partial recovery of DMSP production capability. Wild-type, dsyB mutant, and complementary strains of J526 and La6 were cultured in MBM medium for 2 days. After adjusting to the same OD600 value, 50 μl were transferred into 450 μl fresh MBM medium with low nitrogen (0.5 mM NH4Cl) and no added l-Met. To investigate whether the phenotype of the dsyB− mutant could be restored by exogenous DMSP, additional DMSP (1 mM) was added into dsyB mutant cultures. All cultures were incubated under 28 °C, 60 MPa for 10 days. Cultures (100 μl) were serially diluted ten-fold and then 10 μl dotted on MA plates. These plates were incubated at 28 °C for 4 days. The growths of wild-type, dsyB mutant, and complementary strains were observed by counting and compared. All assays were performed in triplicate.

The study comprised two phases, both of which involved analysis of clinical isolates collected from hospitals in China. The first focused on surveillance of tet(X) genes in clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates collected from 77 hospitals located in 26 provinces and municipalities in China during the period 1994 to 2019, including Anhui, Beijing, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jilin, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Sichuan, Tianjing, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Chongqing. The second phase included surveillance of tet(X) genes in non-duplicated clinical strains of different Gram-positive bacterial species including Flavobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter. spp., Burkholderia. spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria collected from seven hospitals located in Zhejiang Province. All isolates were collected as part of an active surveillance process conducted in China. Ethical permission for this study was given by the Zhejiang University ethics committee with the reference No. 2019-074. All strains were subjected to species confirmation using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). All isolates were subjected to screening of tet(X) orthologues by PCR and Sanger sequencing according to methods published previously. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tet(X)-positive strains against 15 commonly used antibiotics (imipenem, meropenem, ceftzaidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline, tobramycin, colistin, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) were determined by the VITEK 2 COMPACT automatic microbiology analyzer, and interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, except tigecycline and colistin, the breakpoints of which were interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The efficiency of plasmid conjugation between 27 tet(X)-carrying strains and the E.coli strain EC600 was tested using the mixed broth method. These strains included 17 randomly selected Flavobacteriaceae strains (5 C. indologenes, 3 E. meningoseptica, 3 E. anophelis, 2 C. bernardetii, 1 C. lactis, 2 Chryseobacterium sp., 1 E. falsenii), as well as strains of E. coli (3), C. freundii (1), S. mizuta (3), Acinetobacter spp. (2), A.nosomialis (1), A. baumannii (1), and P. xiamenensis (1). Transconjugants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with 1 μg mL−1 tigecycline and 600 μg ml−1 rifampicin. PCR was conducted to confirm the presence of tet(X) genes; MALDI-TOF MS was applied to confirm the species identity of the transconjugants. MIC of the transconjugants was tested using the aforementioned method. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to test whether tet(X) genes in the two Acinetobacter spp. strains susceptible to tigecycline were expressed. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was treated with Invitrogen TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), followed by reverse transcription using the Invitrogen SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was conducted in a Light Cycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics), using primers in Supplementary Table 1. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The 16S rRNA gene of Acinetobacter spp. were amplified with previously published primers and used as endogeneous reference genes. A. baumannii ATCC 19606 with a tigecycline MIC of 0.5 μg mL−1 was used as the reference strain. Relative expression levels of the tet(X) genes were obtained by the ΔΔCT analysis method. Genomic DNA was extracted from overnight cultures by using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All isolates carrying the tet(X) genes were subjected to whole genome sequencing using the HiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Genome assembly was conducted with SPAdes v3.12.0. Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was conducted to obtain the complete genome sequences of strains carrying the tet(X) gene, using the SQK-RBK004 sequencing kit and flowcell R9.5. Hybrid assembly of Illumina and nanopore sequencing reads was constructed using Unicycler v 0.3.0. Genome sequences were annotated using RAST v2.0 with manual editing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of all Enterobacteriaceae isolates was conducted using MLST v2.11. Acquired antibiotic resistance genes were identified by ResFinder 2.1. Heatmap of antimicrobial resistance genes was plotted using Genesis v1.7.7. Plasmid replicons were analyzed using PlasmidFinder 2.1. Insertion sequences (ISs) were identified using ISfinder v2.0. The genetic location of the tet(X) gene was determined by aligning the contigs carrying tet(X) with complete genome sequences in the NCBI database and those generated in this study. 16S rRNA genes of all isolates were obtained using Barrnap v0.9. Integrative and conjugative elements were predicted using ICEberg2. GC-content of all genome assemblies were calculated using CLC Genomics Workbench v9 (Qiagen, CA, USA). We searched PubMed with no language restriction for articles that contained the terms tet(X), tet(X) and tigecycline resistance, tigecycline resistance gene to retrieve information on previously published tet(X)-positive isolates, including isolation source, year of isolation and location of the tet(X) genes. These isolates were classified according to Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Information of tet(X)-positive strains both from previous studies and this study were plotted to create a classification figure using Adobe Illustrator v22.1. To identify sequence homologous to tet(X) and its orthologues, a BLASTp v.2.10.0 search was performed using the amino acid sequences of TetX to TetX5 as query sequences. In order to avoid BLAST hits from very closely related species, uncultured environmental samples were excluded from the search and the max target sequences acquired were 100. The top unique protein sequences were selected and submitted to the Guidance2 server to evaluate the quality of the alignment and identify potential regions and sequences that reduce the quality of alignment. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE v3.8.31 with default parameters. A model with the least score (JTT + I) evaluated using the Models function in MEGA 7 was selected as the best amino acid substitution model to reconstruct the Maximum-Likehood tree. Gaps and missing data were treated as partial deletions. Results were validated using 1000 bootstrap replicates.

NPs were prepared through the re-precipitation method. Briefly, BAQ derivatives in methanol were added dropwise into MilliQ water while stirring for 5 min (volume ratio, 1:10), and then homogenous NPs were obtained after rotary evaporation (40 °C, 20 min), followed by the characterisation with Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern). The TEM samples were prepared by dropping 0.5 mM NPs on carbon square mesh and dried naturally, which were then observed under the Talos L120C TEM (FEI) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. To determine the drug content in nanoformulations, the prepared drug-loaded NPs were cut off by centrifugal filter (ultracel-10 kDa, Millipore), and the absorbance of filtrate (diluted with DMSO, 1:10, volume ratio) was measured for calculation of drug concentrations. Cell viability was assessed by the MTS assay. Briefly, cells in 96-well plates (4000 cell per well) were treated as indicated, followed by the incubation with MTS regents for 4 h. OD values (490 nm) were determined via a microplate reader. Results were shown as the average cell viability calculated from the formula of [(ODtreat − ODblank)/(ODcontrol − ODblank) × 100%]. Drug combination data were analyzed by Combenefit 2.02. In cell growth assay, cells in 6-well plates (50,000 cell per well) were treated as indicated and were counted manually every 24 h. Colony formation assay was also performed on 6-well plates with a starting density of 1000–2000 cells per well. After incubated as indicated for 10–20 days, cells were washed with PBS and stained with the solution of crystal violet and methanol for 20 min. Cell apoptosis was measured using FITC-Annexin V/PI Apoptosis kit (AnaSpec). Briefly, the treated cells were stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions and were detected on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. Data were analyzed by FlowJo 7.6.1. In caspase 3/7 activity assay, cells in 96-well plates (10,000 cells per well) were treated as indicated, followed by adding AMC caspase-3/7 assay kit (50 µL per well, AnaSpec). The fluorescence intensity (λex = 356 nm, λem = 442 nm) was recorded by a microplate reader. For cell uptake, lysosomes were labelled with Alexa Fluor 488-dextran (10 kDa, 100 µg mL−1, Thermo Fisher) for 36 h, followed by incubation with DiD-loaded BAQ NPs (10 uM, 1:10, mass ratio) for 2 h. In lysosomal deacidification analysis, cells were treated for 2 h and incubated with LysoTracker Red (100 nM, Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. Cell images were obtained using a Zeiss Confocal Microscope and analyzed by Zen 2.3 and ImageJ 1.51 s. Lysosomal integrity was measured in living cells by using the AO (Thermo Fisher) or Alexa Fluor 488-dextran (10 kDa) staining. For AO staining, the treated cells were incubated with AO (2 µg mL−1) for 1 h. For dextran staining, the dextran-loaded cells were exposed to treatments for 12 h. Images were captured under a Zeiss Confocal Microscope and analyzed by Zen 2.3 and ImageJ 1.51 s. Cells in a 96-well plate (5000 cell per well) were transfected by the autophagy sensor LC3B-GFP (Thermo Fisher) for 12 h. After treated as indicated for 4 h, cells were visualised by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). The puncta per well were quantified using ImageJ 1.51 s. Lysosomes were isolated using a Lysosome Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The equal portions of isolated lysosomes were incubated as indicated for 12 h at 37 °C and then was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet intact lysosomes. The release of cathepsin B into the supernatant was determined (Ex = 380 mm, Em = 460 mm) after a 2 h incubation with 200 μM fluorogenic Cathepsin B Substrate III (Z-Arg-Arg-AMC). Red blood cells (2%) in PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) were incubated with NPs for 4 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, the extent of haemolysis was spectrophotometrically determined according to the amount of haemoglobin in supernatants (540 nm). The haemolysis assay was used to assess the pH-dependent detergence ability and toxicity of NPs. The cell or tumour samples were lysed with RIPA Buffer (Thermo Fisher). After centrifugation at 4 °C (15 min, 12,000 × g), the concentrations of proteins in supernatant and determined by Bradford Protein Assay dye (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed routinely and were developed using a ChemiDocTM MP imaging system. MIA PaCa-2 cells in 8-well slide plates (30,000 cell per well, Lab-Tek) were treated as indicated for 48 h. The freshly harvested tumours were cut into 1 mm3 pieces. Samples were fixed with the 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde, and transferred onto carbon square mesh, followed by observation under Talos L120C TEM. Total RNA was extracted by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) from the treated MIA PaCa-2 cells (5 μM, 24 h). Samples were submitted to the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Centre’s Genomics Shared Resource (GSR) for RNA-Seq analysis. Stranded RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from 100 ng total RNA using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England BioLabs). Subsequently, libraries were combined for multiplex sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 System (2 × 150 bp, paired-end, >20 × 106 reads per sample). The data of normalised genes read counts were analyzed using fold change and t test. The Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were collected for the signalling pathways enrichment by Funrich software 3.1.3. The gene sets were from MSigDB database (Broad Institute). GSEA was performed using GSEA version 3.0 in KEGG gene sets category online, with the following parameters: n = 1000 permutations, where p adjust < 0.05, and FDR < 0.05 were considered significant. The total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) and the phenol-chloroform extraction method. The cDNA was synthesised using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of total RNA in a 20 μL reaction. The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:20 in nuclease-free water and 4 μL was used per qPCR reaction with triplicates. qPCR was carried out using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) including a non-template negative control. Amplification of GAPDH was used to normalise the level of mRNA expression. The primer sequences were listed in Supplementary Table 4. MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with compounds (2.5 μM) for 48 h, and 1.5 million cells in each group were collected to prepare the samples routinely for RPLC-QTOF analysis. The samples were run on a Vanquish UHPLC System, followed by data acquisition using a Q-Exactive HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer. The LC–MS data were processed using MS-DIAL 3.70. Statistical analysis was done by first normalising data using the sum of the knowns, or mTIC normalisation, to scale each sample. Normalised peak heights were then submitted to R 3.5.1 for statistical analysis. ANOVA analysis was performed with FDR correction and post hoc testing. To establish the subcutaneous xenograft models, 5 × 106 of MIA PaCa-2 cells, 2 × 106 of HT29 cells or 2 × 104 PCSCs suspended with Matrigel (Corning) and PBS mixture (1:1, volume ratio) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice or NRG mice, respectively. The NRG mice bearing MIA PaCa-2 xenograft tumours (~100 mm3) were randomised into 5 groups (n = 6), and then were subjected to iv injection every 3 days as indicated. For HT29 xenograft model, six groups of nude mice (n = 6) with 100 mm3 of tumours were administrated every 3 days with vehicle (saline, iv), Lys05 (ip), BAQ12 NPs (iv), BAQ13 NPs (iv), Irinotecan (ip), respectively. The treatment on HT29 model was stopped on Day 24, and then the mice survival in each group was recorded, in which the mouse with a tumour larger than 1000 mm3 was considered dead. For the co-delivery study, NRG mice (n = 5) bearing PCSC tumours were treated with vehicle (saline, iv), napabucasin (ip), BAQ13 NPs (iv), BAQ13 NPs+napabucasin (iv and ip, respectively) and BAQ13 NPs@napabucasin (iv) every 3 days. The tumour volume and body weight were recorded before drug administration every time. At the end of the treatment, mice were sacrificed and the tumours were collected for further analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. Data are presented as mean values ± SD, n = biological replicates or independent nanoparticle sample replicates. One-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s multiple comparison test or two-tailed Student’s t test was used to calculate the p value as noted in each figure legend. ns not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.

Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific unless otherwise specified. HEK293 cells and fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Gene editing of endogenous ATXN2 in HEK293 cells to express ATXN2 with 58 CAG repeats was performed with CRISPR/Cas9 according to the published protocols [20], as detailed previously in our work [2]. Cells were periodically screened by PCR to confirm the preservation of ATXN2-Q58. Fibroblasts from patients were obtained from a skin punch biopsy or from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ, USA). All subjects biopsied gave written consent and procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah (IRB_00035351 and IRB_00040048). Supplementary Table 1 lists all human fibroblasts, their genetic mutation and repository identification number. All mutations were verified by PCR sequencing. Identity authentication of HEK293 cells and human fibroblasts was carried out by short tandem repeat analysis with the GenePrint 24 System (Promega, USA) and mycoplasma testing was carried out regularly. All mice were housed and bred in standard vivarium conditions and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Utah. The Stau1 (Stau1−/−) mouse [5] was a generous gift from Prof. Michael A. Kiebler, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany. Stau1−/− mice were maintained in a C57BL/6BJ background and Pcp2-ATXN2[Q127] (ATXN2) mice [21] were maintained in a B6D2F1/J background. ATXN2 (Pcp2-ATXN2[Q127]) mice [21] were crossed with Stau1 (Stau1−/−) mouse to generate ATXN2
Stau1 and ATXN2
Stau1. These mice were then bred to produce ATXN2
Stau1 and ATXN2
Stau1 in a mixed background of B6D2F1/J and C57BL/6J. Animals were genotyped according to the previously published protocols [5, 22]. To obtain western blot samples, mice were sacrificed at 34 weeks of age. Cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from WT or Stau1−/− neonatal mice euthanized according to the IACUC approved protocols. Cortices from 6 to 7 animals were isolated, cut into 2 mm segments, and incubated with 50 units of papain (Worthington Biochemical, USA) in Earle’s balanced salt solution with 1.0 mM l-cysteine and 0.5 mM EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Digested tissue was washed with EBSS and mechanical dissociation was performed with a 1 ml micropipette in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml of DNase1 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell suspension was filtered through a 40 µm strainer (Corning) to remove any remaining aggregates. Neurons were seeded on poly-l-ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich) and laminin coated plates at a density of 50,000 per cm2 in Neurobasal Plus medium containing 2% B27 Plus supplement. To prevent proliferation of glial cells 1 µM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma-Aldrich) was added on day 2 and 90% of the media volume was changed after 24 h. From there on, 60% of culture medium was replenished every 2–3 days. Experiments were conducted on day 9–10 by replacing all culture media with fresh media containing thapsigargin or vehicle (DMSO). Plasmid construct 3xFlag-tagged STAU1 (3xF-STAU1) was prepared as detailed previously [2]. All constructs were cloned into a pCMV-3xFlag plasmid (Agilent Technologies, USA) and verified by sequencing. The sequences or commercial origin of all siRNAs used in this study are listed in the Supplementary Table 4. For siRNA experiments HEK293 cells or fibroblasts were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 and harvested after 72 h. For overexpression of recombinant proteins in HEK293 cells we utilized lipofectamine 3000 for 4 h and harvested after 72 h. For experiments involving both overexpression of recombinant protein and siRNA, HEK293 cells were transfected as specified for recombinant protein and 24 h later for siRNA. Cells harvested 48 h after the last transfection. Information on the pharmacological agents used to treat cells are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Protein homogenates from cultured cells were prepared by scraping cells in phosphate buffered saline and lysing the pellets in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), followed by boiling for 5 min. Tissues were manually homogenized with a pestle in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 M urea, and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich)). After clarification supernatants were mixed with Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. All protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond P membrane (Amersham Bioscience), blocked in Tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween-20 with 5% skim milk and primary antibody was incubated overnight in this same solution or 5% bovine serum albumin when antibodies were directed against phosphorylated epitopes. Information about all antibodies used in Supplementary Table 2. After incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody signal was detected using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (EMD Millipore) or SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and photographed with a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc. Analysis and quantification was performed with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). Relative protein abundance was first normalized against actin band intensity and then expressed as the ratio to the normalized control. Cells were cultured in NUNC Lab-Tek chamber slides, fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% in phosphate buffered saline, and staining was performed according to the previously published protocols [21, 23]. Imaging was performed at the Fluorescence Microscopy Core Facility, a part of the Health Sciences Cores at the University of Utah. RNA extraction from cell cultures was performed with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and cDNA was prepared from 1 µg of RNA with the ProtoScript cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed at the Genomics Core Facility, a part of the Health Sciences Cores at the University of Utah. PCR reactions were carried out with Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH levels and analyzed with the relative standard curve method. Cytotoxicity was quantified with the CytoScanTM LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (G-Biosciences). WT and Stau1−/− fibroblasts were plated in 96-well plates and treated with thapsigargin for 24 h. Cell culture supernatant was then collected and LDH was quantified following the manufacturer’s instructions for chemical compound induced cytotoxicity. Results were normalized for each genotype against a maximum LDH release (cells incubated with lysis buffer) and a spontaneous LDH activity (untreated control cells). Cytotoxicity percentage was then calculated as ((compound treated − spontaneous LDH activity)/(maximum LDH release − spontaneous LDH activity)) × 100. All results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless noted otherwise. Comparisons between groups were made using the Student’s t test in OriginPro 2017 software. Level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Levels of significance are noted as *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, and ns = p > 0.05, unless otherwise specified.
The Ethical Committee on Human Experimentation from Centro de Pesquisas em Medicina Tropical (CEP-CEPEM 096/2009), the Brazilian National Ethical Committee (CONEP 15653) from Ministry of Health and the Institutional Review Board from the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS, IRB-ID11116) approved this study performed with malaria patients. Experiments with mice were conducted according to institutional guidelines for animal ethics and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz-Minas, CEUA/LW15/14, and LW16/18) and UMMS (IACUC/A-2371-15), respectively. Healthy donors volunteers (n = 8) from Porto Velho or Belo Horizonte were used as negative controls.

Written informed consent was obtained before enrollment of all subjects. Up to 100 mL of peripheral blood was collected immediately after confirmation of P. vivax or P. falciparum infection by a standard thick blood smear. Peripheral blood was also collected from healthy donors living in an endemic area. All mouse lineages used in this study have been backcrossed for at least ten generations into the C57BL/6 genetic background. Casp11, Casp1/11, and Gsdmd were provided by Dr. Vishva Dixit from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Caspase-1/11 and Tlr3 mice were provided by Dr. Richard Flavell from Yale University (New Haven, CT). The Casp1 mice were provided by Dr. Devi Kanneganti Thirumala from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). Ripk3, Ripk3/Casp8, and Ripk3/Casp8/1/11 were provided by Egil Lien. The Tlr9, Tlr4, and Tlr7 mice were provided by Dr. Shizuo Akira from Osaka University (Osaka, Japan). The Ripk3/Casp8/Gsdmd and Tlr3/7/9 mice were generated in our laboratory by genetic crosses. The C57BL/6, Ifng, Tnfr, Ifnar1, and 129S6 were originally obtained from Jackson Labs. All mouse lineages mentioned above were bred and maintained in microisolators at Fiocruz-Minas and UMMS on a 12 h dark/light cycle, temperature range was 68–79 °F, and humidity between 30 and 70%. Female and male mice between 6 and 10 weeks old were used in all experiments. The P. chabaudi chabaudi AS and P. berghei ANKA strains were used for experimental infection and kept in our laboratory as previously described. Briefly, P. chabaudi and P. berghei strains were maintained in C57BL/6 mice by passages once and twice a week, respectively. For experimental infection, wild-type and various knockout mice were infected i.p. with 105 infected red blood cells diluted in PBS 1×. In some experiments, mice 0 (uninfected controls) and 8 days post infection with P. chabaudi were challenged with LPS (serotypes O55:B55 or 0111:B4 from E. coli —Sigma and InvivoGen, respectively) and plasma collected 8 h later. LPS was used at a concentration 10 μg/mouse, as indicated. In experiments with P. berghei ANKA, mice were followed daily for survival and to score clinical symptoms. ECM signs included ruffled fur, abnormal postural responses, reduced reflexes, reduced grip strength, coma, and convulsions. Mice that demonstrated complete disability in all parameters or died between days 7 and 12 post infection were considered as having ECM. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood on Ficoll-paque Plus (GE Healthcare). Monocytes were purified from PBMCs of P. vivax and P. falciparum-infected patients or healthy donors by using immunomagnetic beads for positive selection of CD14+ cells (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Sigma) solution with a protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher). Spleens from control and infected mice were passed through a 100-μm nylon cell strainer. After the first centrifugation (5 min 400 × g), tissue supernatant was collected. Erythrocytes were then lysed, washed, and splenocytes resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, ThermoFisher). In some experiments, splenocytes (2 × 106 cells) were stimulated in vitro with 1 μg/ml of LPS for 24–48 h. For experiments with CD11b+ cells purified from splenocytes, immunomagnetic beads for positive selection of CD11b+ cells (Miltenyi Biotec) were used. Bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice were cultured in DMEM (Corning) with 10% FBS, 10 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, ThermoFisher), and 20% L929 supernatants. After 7 days 2 × 106 BMDMs were cultured in 48-wells plate in 300 μl of medium without FBS. The BMDM were stimulated with 1:5 of red blood cells (RBC) or infected RBCs (iRBC), 40 ng/ml of IFNγ (Sigma), and 500 U/ml of IFN-I (Pbl Assay Science), as indicated in the figure legends. Between 16 and 24 h of in vitro stimulation, BMDMs were lysed with RIPA buffer (Sigma) solution. Culture supernatants were collected, and the soluble proteins were precipitated using chloroform (25% of supernatant volumes) and methanol (same supernatant volumes). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the proteins pellet was dried in 56 °C and suspended in sample buffer. Total of mouse splenocytes, CD11b+ cells, BMDM, or monocytes from patients were lysed with RIPA buffer solution with a protease inhibitor cocktail. After 15 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The proteins were separated in a 12%-acrylamide (caspase-11 and caspase-8) or 4–12% acrylamide (caspase-1/caspase-4/GSDM-D) NUPAGE Bis-tris Protein gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with caspase-11 (Novus Biologicals, 1:1000), caspase-1 (Adipogen, 1:1000), caspase-4 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), anti-mouse and anti-human caspase-8 (Enzo Life Science, 1:1000), anti-mouse cleaved caspase-8 (Cell Signaling, 1:500), anti-GSDM-D (sigma, 1:1000) and β-actin (Sigma, 1:2000) specific antibodies, then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:25,000) and detected with Clarity Max ECL Substrate (Biorad) using ImageLab Touch Software V6.0.1 (Bio-Rad). Bands quantification was performed with ImageStudio V5.2. Uncropped western blot is available in the Supplementary Information file (Supplementary Figs. 5–11). Measurements of mouse IL-1β and TNFα in plasma or supernatant of splenocyte cultures were performed using commercially available ELISA Duoset kit (ThermoFisher). Absorbance was read with SOFTmaxPRO V4.3.1 LS. Splenocytes (5 × 106 cells) from mice at 0 (uninfected controls) and 8 days post infection were harvested 2 h after challenge with LPS and stained with fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for cell surface markers or cytokines. The following flow cytometry mAbs specific were used: CD11c-Alexa fluor 700 (1:100), MHC II-APCCy7 (1:200), F4/80- APC (Biolegend, 1:200), CD11b-PECy7 (1:4000), pro-IL-1β-FITC (eBioscience, 1:100), and AmCyan (Live/Dead kit, ThermoFisher). The intracellular fixation and permeabilization buffer set of eBioscience (ThermoFisher) were used to perform pro-IL-1β stain. Spleens from the C57BL/6 control uninfected and PbA-infected mice, at 5 days post infection, were harvested, and splenocytes stained with Ly6G (FITC, 1:400) CD11b (PECy7, 1:4000), F4/80 (PECy5, 1:200), CD11c (Alexa fluor 700, 1:100), MHC II (APCCy7, 1:200), and DC-SIGN (APC e-fluor 660, 1:800) and then submitted to purification by using a cell sorting ARIA (BD). These cells were first gated on FSC-H/FSC-A, to avoid doublets. Next, we gated on Ly6G−, then CD11b+F4/80+. Cells from noninfected controls were then gated on MHC II- DC-SIGN- and from infected mice on MHC IIhigh DC-SIGNhigh. The gated cells were sorted, collected into fresh new tubes, the MO-DCs were confirmed to be CD11c+ and then used for RNA extraction and RNA-Seq. RNA-seq was performed in biological replicates (three mice per group). Monocytes and MO-DCs were purified from splenocytes using a cell sorting ARIA (BD). Since PbA infection leads to severe cerebral symptoms and death after the 6th day of infection, MO-DCs (CD11b+F4/80+CD11c+DC-Sign+MHC II+) were collected from PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice at day 5 post infection and monocytes (CD11b+F4/80+CD11c−DC-Sign−MHC II−) collected from noninfected mice. The total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and was cleaned and treated with DNase I (Qiagen). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kit (ILLUMINA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA and library quality were verified by fragmentation analysis (Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer) and submitted for sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 500 (Bauer Core Facility Harvard University). Reads previously trimmed with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al.) were mapped to the Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Build 38 patch release 5 (GRCm38.p5) using STAR aligner (Dobin et al.) and the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per million mapped read (FPKM) values and the differential analysis were calculated with CUFFLINKS (Trapnell et al.). Genes which were differentially expressed in response to the infection with fold change ≥ 1.5 were analyzed for pathway enrichment and network analysis with IPA– Ingenuity Pathway Analysis from Qiagen (USA); and graphs were done in R statistical environment, version 3.4.3 (R Core Team, 2019) and Cytoscape software (Shannon et al.). Please see Supplementary Table 1. All data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism V7.0 Software. The differences between two groups were verified using t test or the Mann–Whitney test for parametric or nonparametric data, respectively, at 95% confidence interval (CI). For analysis of multiple groups, we used one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with additional Bonferroni’s test at 95% CI. Differences were considered statistically significant when the P < 0.05. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
A 30-cm-long sediment core was obtained from a water depth of 125 m the Namibian continental shelf (18.0 S, 11.3 E) during F/S Meteor Expedition M148-2 “EreBUS” on July 10th, 2018. In brief, the core was acquired with a multi corer (diameter 10 cm), which yielded an intact sediment/water interface and the upper 30 cm of sediment. After retrieval, cores were moved immediately to a 4 °C cold room and stored at 4 °C until being sectioned every 2 cm after 20 h. The core was 30 cm long, which was sectioned into 2-cm intervals. Thus, the deepest interval sectioned was between 28 and 30 cm. Sections were transferred immediately into sterile, DNA/RNA free 50 mL falcon tubes and then frozen immediately at −20 °C until DNA and RNA extractions. Pore water geochemistry measurements were performed acquired from the same core, methodology and data have been published elsewhere [31] and the results are reported in this publication in the Fig. 1b. Between 1 and 4 g of deep-frozen sediment from nine sediment depths were thawed and washed over a 63-micron mesh sieve. The residue was immediately wet-sorted and all test of foraminifera were separated from sediment particles, identified to a genus level following Altenbach and Leiter [26] and enumerated. Representative specimens were photographed using a KEYENCE VHX-6000. RNA was extracted as previously described [31]. In brief, RNA was extracted from 0.5 g of sediment using the FastRNA Pro Soil-Direct Kit (MP Biomedicals) following the manufacturer’s instructions with final elution of templates in 40 µL PCR water (Roche) as described previously [31] with some modifications to maximize RNA yield and reduce DNA contamination. The first modification was that, after the supernatant was removed after first homogenization step, a second homogenization was performed with an additional 500 µL RNA Lysing Buffer. The tubes were centrifuged once again for 5 min at maximum speed, and the supernatant from the second homogenization was combined with that resulting from the first homogenization, continuing with the protocol from the manufacturer. Second, we added glycogen at a concentration of 1 µg/mL during the 30-min isopropanol precipitation in order to maximize recovery of the RNA pellet. To reduce DNA contamination, we extracted all RNA samples in a HEPA-filtered laminar flow hood dedicated only for RNA work (no DNA allowed inside) that also contains dedicated RNA pipettors used exclusively inside the hood with RNA samples. All surfaces were treated with RNAse-Zap prior to extractions and exposed to UV light for 30 min before and after each extraction. Metatranscriptomes were prepared as previously described [31]. In brief, DNAse treatment, synthesis of complementary DNA and library construction were obtained from 10 µL of RNA templates by processing the Trio RNA-Seq kit protocol (NuGEN Technologies). Libraries were quantified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System, using the High Sensitivity DNA reagents and DNA chips (Agilent Genomics). The libraries constructed using specific barcodes, pooled at 1 nM, and sequenced in two separate sequencing runs with a paired-end 300 mid output kit on the Illumina MiniSeq. A total of 40 million sequences were obtained after Illumina sequencing, which could be assembled de novo into 41,230 contigs. Quality control, de novo assembly, and ORFs searches were performed as described previously [31], with some minor modifications. In brief, transcripts were trimmed and paired-end reads assembled into contigs using CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/), using a word size of 20, bubble size of 50, and a minimum contig length of 300 nucleotides. Reads were then mapped to the contigs using the following parameters (mismatch penalty = 3, insertion penalty = 3, deletion penalty = 3, minimum alignment length = 50% of read length, minimum percent identity = 95%). Eukaryotic ORFs were detected in contigs using the eukaryotic code for translations and ORF predictions using TransDecoder v5.5.0 [49], whereas bacterial and archaeal ORFs were identified using FragGeneScan version 1.30 [50] with the following arguments -w 1 -t illumina_10. We did not do an rRNA depletion step, but still recovered mostly mRNA in our libraries. This is partly because the Trio RNA-seq Ovation kit that we used (NuGen technologies) is biased against molecules with secondary structure such as rRNA, and thus preferentially amplifies mRNA. However, BLASTn searches of the remaining reads that did not assemble into contigs confirmed that the unassembled reads were mostly rRNA. Thus, the de novo assembler that we used does not assemble rRNA into contigs, possibly because of its conserved nature. Thus, the vast majority of assembled data is from mRNA because of the preference of the SPIA amplification against molecules like rRNA with secondary structure, and also because of the assembly method used being biased against rRNA. A total of 8556 ORFs were found that were then searched for similarity using BLASTp against a database [31] containing predicted proteins from all protist, fungal, bacterial, and archaeal genomes and MAGs in the JGI and NCBI databases using DIAMOND version 0.9.24 [46]. This database, which we refer to as “MetaProt” also contained all ORFs from all of the transcriptomes of microbial eukaryotes from the MMETS project [14] and all of the ORFs from the recently published foraminiferal genome and transcriptome containing the novel denitrification pathway [10]. This custom MetaProt database that we used for this study is available as a single 32 GB amino acid fasta file on the LMU Open Data website (10.5282/ubm/data.183). Cutoff for assigning hits to specific taxa, or to a specific KOG category, were a minimum bit score of 50, minimum amino acid similarity of 30, and an alignment length of 50 residues. We assigned ORFs as being derived from Foraminifera if they had a significant similarity above this threshold to a predicted protein from a previously sequenced Foraminifera transcriptome or genome. Because our database contains predicted proteins from >700 transcriptomes of other microbial eukaryotes, we are confident that this level of stringency is sufficient to make a broad level of taxonomic assignment of ORFs from the metatranscriptomes to Foraminifera in general (as opposed to being actually derived from other protist groups). Normalization of the relative abundance of ORFs (e.g., the relative abundances shown in Figs. 2 and 5) was performed as done previously [31]. Namely, that the number of ORFs assigned per protist group (e.g., Foraminifera) are represented as a fractional percentage, divided by the total number of ORFs with significant similarity (minimum bit score of 50, minimum amino acid similarity of 30, and an alignment length of 50 residues) to a predicted protein from a genome present in the database found with DIAMOND searches. We normalized expression in this manner, as opposed to more conventional procedures such as RPKM because we found that the RNA-seq kit we used has an amplification step (SPIA amplification, Trio RNA-seq Ovation kit, and NuGen) that biases the relative abundance of reads mapping to contigs when normalized using RPKM. For example, the RPKM value for the same ORF across technical replicates was found to have very large (orders of magnitude) variability in RPKM. In contrast, the total number of unique ORFs (e.g., presence/absence of an expressed ORF) assign to specific groups (e.g., Foraminifera) was highly consistent between technical replicates. We assume that this technical variation in the RNA-seq data is associated with randomized SPIA amplification of different transcripts, and or fluctuations in the number of mRNA molecules in technical replicate tubes due to the highly labile nature of RNA during the extraction and library prep procedure. For this reason, we normalized the relative abundance of ORFs assigned to a specific group based on presence/absence of expressed ORFs which was highly consistent between technical replicates despite the SPIA amplification. If significantly higher numbers of unique ORFs are detected from a particular group compared with other groups it can be attributed to a relatively higher transcriptional activity. ORFs assigned as Foraminifera were then additionally annotated against the Cluster of KOG database [15], using DIAMOND [46] with the same parameters as above. The lack of metatranscriptomic ORFs having highest similarity to Bolivina and Stainforthia (Fig. S2) is easily explained by the lack of transcriptome data from representatives of these genera in public databases. Nevertheless, because we cannot be sure from which species each of our metatranscriptome ORF derives, we annotated all of the ORFs having highest similarity to a previously sequenced Foraminifera transcriptome or genome, as being derived from Foraminifera. Groups of contaminating organisms were identified via the sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from extraction blanks and more than five separate replicates of laboratory dust samples [51]. We used these data to compile a list of all genera present as contaminants in our laboratory dust and extraction blanks, and then removed any ORFs from the metatranscriptomes having significant similarity to predicted proteomes from those same genera in the list. Contaminants were mostly associated with skin and soil associated bacterial genera including Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Rhizobium, Ralstonia, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia which are commonly known to be contaminants in molecular reagent kits [52]. All metatranscriptomes had <10% ORFs from contaminating taxa. Immediately after core retrieval and freezing of the core top samples, 2-g aliquots of sediment from the core top was added to four 20 mL sterile glass vials (for t1, t2, t3, and t4 timepoints) containing sterile oxygen sensor spots (PreSens Precision Sensing). Oxygen was measured noninvasively using the Fibox (PreSens Precision Sensing) as described previously [53]. The sediment was overlaid with ca. 18 mL of the natural hypoxic bottom water collected in the multicore leaving no air in the headspace, and crimp sealed with gray rubber butyl stoppers. The flasks were incubated on the side and oxygen sensor spots were positioned at the top (to measure oxygen in the overlying seawater) and bottom (to measure oxygen at the base of the sediment) of the flask (see Fig. 5 for a photo of the setup). The flasks were incubated in the dark at 10 °C and taped to the surface of the bench to prevent rolling and mixing of the tube. Each of the four flasks for the timepoints were frozen separately at the respective timepoints t1 (18 h), t2 (3 days), t3 (7 days), and t4 (10 days) immediately at −20 °C. Because the incubation was setup immediately after core retrieval and freezing the core top samples, the frozen core top samples served as the t0 samples for the start of the incubation. RNA extractions, metatranscriptomes, and bioinformatic processing was performed as described above. To identify the likely active foraminifera taxa in the sediments, we searched for foraminiferan 18S rRNA OTUs present within the metatranscriptomes. We performed BLASTn searches (Discontiguous Megablast, e-value 1E−10). As query we used a small custom-made database of complete foraminifera sequences based on Pawlowski et al. [54] and Holzmann and Pawlowski [55]. The resulting OTUs were reciprocally blasted against NCBI’s nr database (Discontiguous Megablast, e-value 1E−10). The two OTUs with highest similarity to Foraminifera 18S rDNA were further used for sequence extensions using a greedy approach. For this, 10 bp on both ends were trimmed from the putative foraminiferan 18S rRNA OTUs to remove possible erroneous bases due to dropping read quality towards the ends of reads. We only extended the OTU fragment matching the last 1000 bp of the foraminiferan 18S rRNA sequences since this is a commonly used foraminifera barcoding region and allows the comparison with a wide diversity of previously barcoded foraminiferan taxa [56]. We performed 20 iterations of greedy extension in GENEIOUS Prime 2019 [57] by mapping trimmed metatranscriptomics reads with TRIMMOMATIC v.0.38 using the default options [58] to the end-trimmed 18S rDNA OTUs. This extended 5′ and 3′ ends of the 18S rRNA OTUs. Both sequences were manually error corrected based on the mapped reads. We carefully and manually proved that read pairs spanned regions of high sequence similarity with other foraminiferans, i.e., highly conserved stem regions of the 18S rRNA. This approach allowed us to unambiguously extend both OTUs to yield the full 18S rRNA barcoding region. These sequences were blasted against the NCBI nr database and showed strong sequence similarity to the benthic foraminifera genera Stainforthia and Bolivina. In order to confirm their taxonomic affiliation and to refine their placement, we established two separate alignment that included 30 sequences of the genus Bolivina [59] on the one hand, and on the other hand 30 sequences of sister genus Stainforthia [60]. The two separate sequence sets were automatically aligned with MAFFT v.7 [61] and a phylogenetic inference was calculated with 1000 nonparametric bootstrapping pseudo replicates based on a BioNJ starting tree using PhyML [62]. The best substitution models were automatically selected using the Smart Model Selection [63] under Akaike Information Criterion and the model GTR + I + G was selected for the Bolivina alignment and the model TN93 + G + I was selected for the Stainforthia alignment. Both trees were visualized using ITOL and are provided in Fig. 3.
Cas9 mRNA and individual sgRNA were together injected into MII oocytes. Wild-type MII oocytes and injected MII oocytes both were performed IVF at the same time. At 7–9 h post fertilization (h.p.f), most of embryos have already developed into PN3–4 stage. We assessed that Cas9-induced DSBs can be resolved efficiently during this period. Meanwhile, we supposed extended time of exposure to MII and zygote cytoplasm could allow CRISPR-Cas9 components to degrade partly before the first DNA replication of one-cell embryos. However, the DSB formation exactly falls within a window that can differentiate parental chromatins at the pronuclear stage (PN3–4) zygotes (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We could isolate the paternal and maternal pronuclei at the PN3–4 stage and exchange them into wild-type embryos that had been depleted paternal and maternal pronuleus, respectively. The cytoplasm of wild-type embryos could make residual Cas9 exists in edited pronulei further diluted and lose activity. Along with these reconstructed embryos developed to blastocysts, we then genotyped individual blastocyst each sample by PCR and TA clone sequencing of respective broken sites to identify which type of embryos they belong to (Fig. 1a). TA clone-sequencing outcomes from individual blastocyst typically exhibit genotypes of only a unique NHEJ mutation and wild type, suggesting that these Cas9-induced mutations at the parental mono-allele sites have been generated at the zygote stage of embryos and the activity of Cas9 is just limited before the first DNA replication. If the outcomes exhibit genotypes of significantly more distinct NHEJ mutations and wild type, suggesting it is more possible that the embryo is a heterozygote with mosaicism. If the outcomes of all clones exhibit NHEJ mutations, suggesting that the embryo is homozygous knockout (Supplementary Fig. 4b). If the outcomes of all clones exhibit wild type, suggesting that the embryo is wild type. The specific patrogen-free mice were housed in the animal facility of Tongji University, Shanghai, China. The use and care of animals complied with the guideline of the Tongji University Guide for the Use of Laboratory Animals. MII oocytes were collected from 8-week-old BDF1 females and 8-week-old C57BL/6 females superovulated by injection with 5 IU each of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG), followed by injection of 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (San-Sheng Pharmaceutical) 48 h later. Zygotes were obtained from the ampulla of the uterine tube of superovulated C57BL/6 or BDF1 female mice after mating with DBA or BDF1 male mice. CZB + Glutamin medium was used for culture of wild type and micromanipulative embryos at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air for 24 h, and 18–20 two-cell stage embryos were transferred into a oviduct of pseudopregnant ICR female at 0.5 d.p.c. T7 promoter was added into Cas9 coding sequence by PCR amplification using PX330 vector and the primer T7-Cas9 (Supplementary Table 5). T7-Cas9 PCR products were collected through agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA), then used as the template for in vitro transcription (IVT) using mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 ULTRA kit (Life Technologies). SgRNA template with T7 promotor at the 5′side by PCR amplification of px330. The T7-sgRNA PCR product was purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA) and used as the template for IVT using MEGA shortscript Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). Cas9 mRNA was purified by lithium chloride precipitation, and sgRNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction. sgRNA and mRNA aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. MII oocytes were collected from superovulated eight-week-old C57 or BDF1 mice. Zygotes were collected from oviducts 24 h post hCG injection. For gene editing of embryos, the mixture of Cas9 mRNA or protein (100 ng µl−1) and sgRNA (150 ng µl−1) was injected into the cytoplasm of MII oocytes or zygotes by using a Piezo impact-driven micromanipulator in a droplet of HEPES-CZB medium. Female BDF1 or C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old) were superovulated by injection with 5 IU of PMSG, followed by injection of 5 IU of hCG (San-Sheng Pharmaceutical) 48 h later. At 14 h after hCG injection, the cumulus oocyte complexes were released from the oviducts. MII oocytes were obtained from the ampulla of the uterine tube. Two cauda epidydimis were collected from one BDF1 or PWK male and cut several times with clippers. Then, they were transferred in a 1.5-ml eppendorf tube with 600 µl G-IVF medium under 5% CO2 in air for 15–30 min to allow sperm to swim out through slits in the bases of cauda. At this time, spermatozoa capacitation was attained in the G-IVF medium. Activated sperm and oocytes were placed in the G-IVF droplets for 3–4 h, then washed and cultured in CZB or G1 medium. MII oocytes were collected from 8-week-old superovulated BDF1 females and followed by IVF with BDF1 or PWK sperm. At 7–9 h.p.f, PN3–4 stage zygotes were collected based on the microscopic observation of the size of the two pronucleus and the distance between them, and transferred into HEPES-CZB medium containing 5 µg ml−1 cytochalasin B and Nocodazole. They were then incubated for 5 min. Then, parental pronucleus were isolated from PN3–4 stage zygotes and incubated 4–5 s in the sendai virus (HVJ, Cosmo-bio), which was used for fusing pronuleus with cytoplasms, then injected into the perivetelline space of embryos that have been depleted another parental pronucleus by using a Piezo impact-driven micromanipulator. The isolated pronucleus were fused into cytoplasms to reconstruct intact zygotes 0.5–1 h later. Then, the reconstructed zygotes were washed and cultured in CZB or G1 medium. Single embryos were picked up and washed for several times with HEPES-CZB medium by using a glass capillary, and then added into 5 µl G1 lysis solution (25 mM NaOH, 0.2 mM EDTA). Each tube was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged briefly. The G1 lysis was incubated at a temperature of 95 °C for 30 min and back to room temperature. Then 5 µl G2 lysis solution (40 mM Tris-HCl) was added to G1 lysis tubes. Each tube was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged briefly again. Then, the products of the lysis program were used as templates in PCR analysis. PCR amplification made use of ExTaq (Takara) enzyme. ExTaq (Takara) was denature at 94 °C for 3 min, and PCR was performed for 40 cycles. The anneal temperature and extended time were changed with different genes. PCR products were performed electrophoresis and extracted by using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA). Then Sanger sequencing was used to detect mutations. About 500–1000 bp DNA fragments around the Anapc2/Fgfr3-targeting site were PCR amplified and sequenced from the single embryos that were treated with Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. And the same DNA fragments were parallelly PCR amplified and sequenced from the control group. The sequencing outcomes of both groups and guide RNA sequences were inputted into the TIDE software (https://tide.deskgen.com/). The parameters were set to the default maximus indel size of 10–15 nucleotides and the cover decomposition window was set to the largest possible window with high quality traces. The composite PCR amplified sequence trace can be decomposed into individual components by standard non-negative linear modeling of TIDE. The proportion of aberrant base signals could be visualized in an intuitive graph (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Meanwhile, the individual indel components of the aberrant sequences could be modeled and quantified at the cut site by the control sequence trace (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The p value of each indel is calculated by a two-tailed t-test of the variance–covariance matrix of the standard error. We used a glass capillary under a dissection microscope to pick up embryos. 4-cell mouse embryos were digested with protease to remove the zona pellucida, and then the embryos were transferred into 0.5% BSA/PBS and gently pipetted to separate individual blastomere. Finally, the individual blastomere was transferred into a PCR tube containing cell lysis buffer (YIKONGenomics). Each tube was centrifuge to facilitate the mix. The procedure of cell lysis and amplification was followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the amplified products were used as templates in PCR analysis. PCR amplification made use of ExTaq (Takara) enzyme. ExTaq (Takara) was denature at 94 °C for 3 min, and PCR was performed for 34 cycles. The anneal temperature and extended time were changed with different genes. PCR products were performed electrophoresis and extracted by using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA). The genotypes of single blastocyst or mouse tissues were determined by PCR of genomic DNA extracted. The PCR products were purified and ligated to PLB-Simple vector (TIANGEN) and transformed to competent Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Culture at 37 °C overnight. Clones were picked to identify by PCR amplification. 2× Taq (TIANGEN) was denature at 95 °C for 3 min and PCR was performed for 34 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and the extended time was changed with different genes. Positive clones were selected to identify by Sanger sequencing. The TA clone sequence outcomes from single blastocyst or cell were analyzed by Snap Gene software. The mutation genotype of single embryo was confirmed by sequence alignment with wild-type sequences. Fixation of freshly collected embryos from micromanipulated and cultured embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30–60 min and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton-X-100 for 20 min. After permeabilization, embryos were washed 3× in PBS. And blocked for 3–4 h in blocking solution (3% BSA in PBS) and incubated with primary antibodies in 3% BSA (1:10). Antibody used were Anti-SpCas9 (Active Motif, Catalog No. 61758). After overnight incubation at 4 °C embryos were washed 3× in PBS, and incubated with second antibodies labeled with Alexa fluorophores (Invitrogen) in 3% BSA for 1–1.5 h at room temperature. After washing 3× in PBS, embryos were incubated with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for visualizing DNA. The samples were observed under a confocal microscope LSM880. From the observation of appearance, the dwarfish-like features between all three Fgfr3G369C del/+ mice generated by Past-CRISPR have been reversed. The body size of these mice have all returned to normal level similar to wild-type mice (Fig. 4d). One of the Fgfr3G369C del/+ mice was picked at random for analyzing micro-CT. As a parallel control group, one Fgfr3G369C/+ mouse and one wild-type mouse of the same age were also performed micro-CT analysis. For micro-CT analyses, the mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were dissected and preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde for microcomputed tomography (µCT 50 Scanco Medical). Skulls, femurs, tibias, jaws, and vertebras were dismembered for some operation. Two-dimensional (2D) data were used from scanned slices (scanning thickness 10 µm), 3D analysis was used to calculate morphometric parameters of the whole femur bone, including BV/TV, trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), Tb.Sp and BMD. The morphometric parameters on the trabecular analysis were valuing by measuring six scattered cross-sections of the distal metaphysis (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 8f, g). For undecalcified bone sections analysis, bone tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated with gradient ethanol and embedded in photocured resin, and then cut into 50-µm sections. The different bone tissues were stained by Von kossa. The ClinVar database was downloaded from NCBI (accessed June 09.2020). The database was filtered for ‘pathogenic’ diseases, resulting in 81,137 entries. And the list of pathogenic variants was filtered for ‘dominant’ diseases, resulting in 1789 entries. We uploaded the resulting databases as Supplementary Data 1 and 2. For validation of methods, at least two independent experiments were performed for every tested gene, and the oocyte or embryo samples (n = 30–50) for each experiment were collected from more than one individual. Quantitative analysis (Figs. 3e, 4h and Supplementary Fig. 1b) was performed by GraphPad Prism 8.0. Error bars in the graphical data represent the standard error of mean (SEM). All statistical significance tests have been indicated in the corresponding figure legend. Statistical comparisons (Figs. 3e, 4h) were made using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple hypothesis correction, p values were considered significant at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001.

Two different D. magna genetic panels have been used in this study. Diversity panel: The Daphnia magna Diversity Panel is a growing collection of D. magna genotypes collected across the entire species range (corresponding approximately to the entire Holarctic) with one genotype per population. All clones are kept clonally in laboratory standard medium (ADaM, [Klüttgen et al. 1994] modified by using only 5% of the recommended selenium dioxide concentration) on a diet of green algae (Scenedesmus sp.) at a temperature of 20 °C and a light: dark cycle of 16:8 (Luijckx et al. 2011). This panel has been used in previous studies (Roulin et al. 2013; Yampolsky et al. 2013; Seefeldt and Ebert 2019), but continues to expand with new D. magna clones. In this study, we used females from 174 clones. The diversity panel was used in this study to investigate the natural diversity of D. magna resistance to attachment and infection by P. ramosa P15 genotype. Recombinant panel: The F2-recombinant QTL panel used in this study was developed by Routtu et al. (2010) and was kept as clonal lines in the laboratory. In brief, this panel originated from the crossing of two divergent D. magna parent clones, one from a Finnish rock pool population (Xinb3) and the other from a pond near Munich, Germany (Iinb1). One F1 offspring was cloned and selfed to produce the F2-recombinant clones. These F2-recombinant clones were typed at about 1300 SNP markers to produce a genetic map (Routtu et al. 2014). Our F2-recombinant QTL panel in this study consisted of two subpanels: the core recombinant panel, a set of randomly chosen F2-recombinant clones, and the extended recombinant panel, a set of F2-recombinant clones selected for their susceptibility to the C19 Pasteuria ramosa genotype (among randomly chosen clones, only 25% are susceptible to this parasite genotype) (see Routtu et al. 2014 for more details). Here we used 208 core panel and 169 extended panel F2-recombinant clones to map and identify the genetic basis of D. magna resistance to P. ramosa P15. Three P. ramosa parasite genotypes were used in this study: C1 and C19 clones were derived from natural isolates of P. ramosa from Moscow, Russia, and Gaarzerfeld, North Germany (see Luijckx et al. 2011), respectively, and have only been observed to attach to the foregut of the host. P15 was isolated from a sample collected in Heverlee, Belgium. It was not cloned, but was passaged multiple times in a susceptible D. magna host clone. For simplicity, we call it here the P15 genotype, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this isolate may contain some within isolate genetic variance. P15 typically attaches to the hindgut of the host, although we have observed a few cases where it attaches to the foregut. The attachment test is a fluorescence-based assay that tests the ability of Pasteuria spores to attach to the fore- or hindgut of the host (Duneau et al. 2011) (Fig. 1b, c). Attachment indicates the parasite’s ability to infect the host, while absence of attachment indicates resistant hosts (Duneau et al. 2011). Attachment is necessary for infection, but hosts may still be resistant if they can either prevent penetration (Duneau and Ebert 2012) or efficiently clear the infection (Hall et al. 2012) in later steps. For the attachment tests, we exposed young host individuals to fluorescently labeled Pasteuria spores. After 30–60 min, the transparent hosts were observed under a fluorescent light to check if spores attached to their esophagus (foregut) or hindgut (Fig. 1b, c). More details of this method are provided in Duneau et al. (2011). Because the scoring of hindgut attachment phenotype is more difficult than the scoring of foregut attachment, there may also be an increased rate of false positives and negatives. We increased the number of replicates of the hindgut attachment (median = 12, max = 39, and min = 6) assays relative to foregut attachment (median = 9, max = 27, and min = 6) in order to increase our power to discern attachment success. All attachment tests were performed without the observer knowing the genotype of the animal being tested. All D. magna genotypes of the two genetic panels mentioned here were tested for their resistance to attachment by P. ramosa P15. For the purpose of these experiments described here, attachment was defined as a binary trait and clones classified as either resistant (no attachment) or susceptible (attachment). To test whether the infection assay protocol developed for foregut-attaching P. ramosa genotypes (Ben-Ami et al. 2010) would also result in successful P15 infections, we selected 40 clones from the QTL panel. Twenty one of these clones showed no P15 hindgut attachment in all tested replicates (P15_hindgut_R), and 19 clones showed P15 hindgut attachment in most or all replicates (P15_hindgut_S). The hindgut infection assay used here followed a modified version of previously published protocols for Pasteuria infections (Ben-Ami et al. 2010). The protocol modification consisted of individually cultured juvenile D. magna being exposed daily to a parasite spore dose high enough to infect susceptible hosts, i.e., those D. magna host genotypes prone to foregut-attaching Pasteuria with 90–100% efficiency (Ben-Ami et al. 2010). This was done to avoid the removal of attached bacterial spore during molting (Duneau and Ebert 2012). In short, hosts were exposed to 50,000 parasite spores per day over 3 days, resulting in a total of 150,000 spores per animal. Exposed D. magna was fed daily with Scenedesmus sp. and kept individually in 80 mL medium (in 100 mL jars) under the same conditions as those in which it was raised (described above). After 40 days, we assessed the number of infected animals. Animals that died during the course of the experiment were not included in the analysis. The final dataset includes, on average, 19.03 replicates per clone. For the purpose of the experiments described in this paper, only the D. magna genotypes of the diversity panel were tested for their resistance to P. ramosa P15 infection. Replicates (mean = 6 replicates, range: 3–15) of each of the 379 F2-recombinant clones of the F2 QTL panel were tested for P15 spore attachment (see “Attachment test” section). See Routtu et al. (2010) for a description of the structure and construction of the SNP array linkage map used. The QTL analysis was performed with R package R/qtl version 1.29–2 (Broman et al. 2003), following the same analysis as described in Routtu and Ebert (2015) and Krebs et al. (2017) and using the same SNP map and QTL panel. In short, Haley–Knott regression (Knott, Haley 1992) was used for robustness and speed of analysis. The assumptions of the model were investigated and confirmed. To find epistatic interactions, we run scantwo (for multidimensional scans with a multiple-QTL model). Finally, using option fitqtl, a defined multiple-QTL model was analyzed (Broman et al. 2003). A genome-wide significance level was established using 10,000 permutation tests with significant (α = 0.05) LOD scores of 3.78. Analysis of variance was used to estimate the proportion of the total variance explained by the fitted models. To fine-map the D locus, clones generated in the Recombinant Panel were scored independently for attachment by P. ramosa P15 spores with two scoring methods: using a binary definition of attachment (resistant or susceptible) as described above and using a continuous definition of attachment where strength of attachment was classified by the observer in a scale from 1 (no attachment) to 10 (strongest attachment). For further details see S1 Methods. We validated the continuous definition of attachment by testing the correlation between the mean of the binary scoring and the median of the quantitative attachment scoring, using the 347 clones of the recombinant panel, which were tested with both methods. The results show that the binary and continuous methods are consistent with each other, and that the correlation is strong (Pearson r = 0.73, n = 347, p < 0.001). For the fine mapping, we selected only those F2 clones that were scored either fully resistant or fully susceptible with both scoring methods before proceeding with the breakpoint mapping. For further details see S1 Methods. The methods for sequencing, assembling, and annotating the Xinb3 and Iinb1 D-locus haplotypes were identical to and are described in detail in Bento et al. (2017). In short, because the region around the QTL where D locus is located was poorly assembled in version 2.4 of the D. magna draft genome (http://wfleabase.org/), we undertook a number of additional sequencing and assembly methods in order to better resolve the focal region. For Xinb3, we generated high- coverage (~60×) PacBio sequencing in order to perform de novo genome assembly. For Iinb1, we took a hybrid Illumina short-read/PacBio long-read approach, generating ~80 × 125 bp PE Illumina coverage and ~15× PacBio long-read coverage. We used the D. magna Xinb3 and Iinb1 haplotype sequences obtained to blast search homologies within and between haplotypes and other genomic regions. In order to understand how expression of individual genes localized to the focal genome regions and to other parts of the genome differed between the Xinb3 and Iinb1 clones, we conducted a de novo transcriptome assembly of the dataset described in Orsini et al. (2016). Finally, we constructed a de novo annotation of each of the transcripts mapping to the D locus by performing blastx (nucleotide-to-protein) searches in the NCBI database. For details on the methods for DNA extraction, genomic sequencing and assembly, and de novo transcriptome assembly mapping annotation see S2 Methods.
(S/R)-thalidomide (Sigma-Aldrich and Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), (S)-thalidomide (Sigma-Aldrich), (R)-thalidomide (Sigma-Aldrich), pomalidomide (Sigma-Aldrich), lenalidomide (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation), (S/R)-5HT were prepared according to a previously published method. (S)-5HT, (R)-5HT, and (S/R)-5HT (Enamine) at 50 mM each were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and stored at ‒20 °C as stock solutions. All the drugs were diluted 1000-fold for the cell degradation analyses or diluted 200-fold for the AS-based analyses using the AS technology. For the crystallization and ITC experiments, (S)-thalidomide and (S)-5-hydroxythalidomide at 1 M were dissolved in DMSO as stock solutions. In this study, the following antibodies were used at each dilution ratio: anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) (1:5000, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated, Sigma-Aldrich, A8592), anti-AGIA rabbit mAb (1:10,000, HRP-conjugated, produced in our laboratory), and anti-Myc mouse mAb (1:3000, HRP-conjugated, Cell Signaling Technology, 2276) were used for the detection of epitope-tagged proteins. Anti-α-tubulin rabbit polyclonal Ab (1:10,000, HRP-conjugated, MBL, PM054-7) was used to detect α-tubulin. Biotinylated proteins were detected by anti-biotin (1:5000, HRP-conjugated, Cell Signaling Technology, 7075). pDONR221 and pcDNA3.1(+) plasmids, based on Gateway technology, were purchased from Invitrogen, and the pEU vector for the wheat cell-free system was constructed in our laboratory. pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-GW, pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-MCS, pcDNA3.1(+)-Myc-MCS, and pEU-bls-GW plasmids were constructed based on each original vector by using the In-Fusion system (TaKaRa Bio) or restriction enzymes. pEU-FLAG-GST-IKZF1 and pEU-FLAG-GST-SALL4 were purchased from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. Open reading frames (ORFs) in SALL4 and IKZF1 were amplified and restriction enzyme sites were added by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-MCS or pcDNA3.1(+)-Myc-MCS. The ORF of CRBN was purchased from the Mammalian Gene Collection. CRBN was amplified, and the BP reaction sequence (attB and attP) was added by PCR and cloned into pDONR221 using BP recombination (Invitrogen). Then, pDONR221-CRBN was recombined into pEU-bls-GW or pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-GW using LR recombination (attL and attR). Amino acid mutation in each protein was generated by inverse PCR and In-Fusion. DNA sequences encoded human CRBN TBD (318‒426 and C366S mutation) and SALL4 ZF2 (410‒432) were cloned into pGEX6P-3 (GE Healthcare), and the recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rossetta(DE3) (Novagen) using lysogeny-broth media supplemented with 20 μM ZnCl2, 100 μg ml‒1 ampicillin, and 17 μg ml‒1 chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C when the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached ~0.6. The cells were collected by centrifugation and were then resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant of the cell lysate was passed over glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare), and resin-bound protein was cleaved overnight by human rhinovirus 3C protease. Proteins eluted from the resin were purified by size-exclusion chromatography with Superdex 75 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP. The fractions containing the CRBN TBD or SALL4 ZF2 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Vivaspin 20 (MWCO 3000, Sartorius) to ~750 μM for the CRBN TBD and 100‒150 μM for SALL4 ZF2. The proteins were stored at ‒80 °C. The concentration of the CRBN TBD was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, and the molecular extinction coefficient was 27,960 M−1 cm−1 using Bradford protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure the concentration of SALL4 ZF2, with bovine serum albumin (BSA) serving as the protein standard. For the AS-based interaction assay, recombinant SALL4–CRBN and IKZF1 were synthesized using a wheat cell-free system. In vitro transcription and translation based on wheat cell-free protein synthesis were performed using a WEPRO1240 expression kit (Cell-Free Sciences). Transcription reactions were conducted by SP6 RNA polymerase using DNA fragments as templates. The translation reactions were performed by the bilayer method using a WEPRO1240 expression kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the synthesis of biotinylated CRBN, 1 µl of cell-free synthesized crude biotin ligase (BirA) was added to the bottom layer, and 0.5 µM (final concentration) of d-biotin (Nacalai Tesque) was added to both the top and bottom layers. The CRBN TBD and SALL4 ZF2 complex was crystallized by sitting-drop vapor diffusion in the presence of (S)-thalidomide or (S)-5HT. The SALL4–CRBN complex solution (104 μM) was prepared by mixing SALL4 ZF2 and the CRBN TBD with 2 mM (S)-thalidomide. The solution was mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 27% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 0.1 M MgCl2, which was then equilibrated against the reservoir solution at 20 °C. For the (S)-5HT-bound SALL4–CRBN complex (70 μM), SALL4 ZF2 was mixed with the CRBN TBD and 1.8 mM (S)-5HT. The complex solution was further mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 22% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, and 0.2 M Li2SO4, which was then equilibrated against the reservoir solution at 20 °C. Each obtained crystal was soaked in the reservoir solution containing 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant using dual thickness MicroMounts (MiTeGen) and then cooled in a liquid nitrogen stream. Diffraction data were collected using a Pilatus 2M-F with an AR-NE3A beamline at the Photo Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The data were indexed and integrated using XDS and scaled using AIMLESS. The crystals of the SALL4–CRBN complex belonged to the space group C2221 with unit cell parameters of a = 70.96, b = 92.72, and c = 43.99 Å for (S)-thalidomide, and a = 83.62, b = 93.89 and c = 43.68 Å for (S)-5HT. The data collection statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The ternary structures of SALL4 ZF2, CRBN TBD, and (S)-thalidomide were determined by molecular replacement with Phaser-MR of the PHENIX program suite using human CRBN TBD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 4TZ4) and IKZF1 (PDB code: 6H0F) as search models. The ternary structures of the CRBN TBD, SALL4 ZF2, and (S)-5HT were determined by molecular replacement in the SALL4–CRBN complex with (S)-thalidomide, as determined in the present study. The iterative model building and refinement cycles were performed using COOT and phenix.refine. All structures were generated with PyMOL (Schrödinger), and the model quality was evaluated with MolProbity. The refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The binding affinity of (S)-5HT to the CRBN TBD was measured by using an isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal iTC200, Malvern) with a reference power of 5 μcal s‒1 and stirring speed of 750 r.p.m. at 25 °C. The CRBN TBD (wild-type or H353A mutant) was dialyzed in a binding buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP, and then DMSO was added to the protein solution at a final concentration of 0.2%. (S)-5HT or (S)-thalidomide was dissolved in DMSO, and the solution was mixed with binding buffer with the DMSO concentration adjusted to 0.2%. For titrations, the (S)-5HT solution (200 μM) or (S)-thalidomide (400 μM) was injected into the sample cell filled with the CRBN TBD solution (10 or 20 μM) in 37 consecutive 1.0-μl aliquots at 120-s intervals. The first injection volume was 0.4 μl, and the observed thermal peak was excluded from the data analyses. Data fitting was performed using the Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab) in the one set of sites mode. The values of the dissociation constant (KD) and molar binding ratio (N) were calculated with mean values ± SD (n = 3 independent experiments). For this assay, we directly used translational mixtures from the wheat cell-free protein production system. Then, 0.5 µl of biotinylated CRBN and 0.8 µl of FLAG-GST-SALL4 or FLAG-GST-IKZF1 was mixed in 15 µl of AS buffer containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.01% Tween-20, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mg ml−1 BSA. Then, 5 µl of a mixture containing 0.0125 µl of IMiD in AS buffer was added, and 20 µl of the mixture was incubated at 26 °C for 1 h in a 384-well AlphaPlate (PerkinElmer). Next, 5 µl of detection mixture containing 0.2 µg ml−1 anti-DYKDDDDK mouse mAb (dilution ratio of 1:2500, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation), 0.08 µl of streptavidin-coated donor beads, and 0.08 µl of protein A-coated acceptor beads (PerkinElmer) in AS buffer was added to each well. After incubation at 26 °C for 1 h, luminescence signals were measured using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (low glucose) (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation), 100 U ml−1 penicillin, and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293T cells were transfected using PEI Max: polyethyleneimine “Max” (MW 40,000) (PolyScience, Inc.). For the generation of CRBN-KO HEK293T cells, the guide nucleotide sequence 5′-ACTCCGGGCGGTTACCAGGC-3′ was selected from the human CRBN gene. The CRBN-KO HEK293T cells were generated as previously published method by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. For experiments using mutant CRBN, the HEK293T-CRBN cells were cultured in 48-well plates and transfected with 200 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-CRBN-WT or 200 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-CRBN-H353A and 15 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-SALL4. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were treated with DMSO (0.1%), thalidomide, or 5HT in culture medium at the indicated concentration for 18 h. For experiments using SALL4 mutants, HEK293T-CRBN cells were cultured in 48-well plates and transfected with 200 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-CRBN-WT and 15 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-SALL4-WT or 15 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-SALL4-mutant. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were treated with DMSO (0.1%), thalidomide, or 5HT in culture medium at the indicated concentration for 18 h. For experiments using mutant IKZF1, the HEK293T-CRBN cells were cultured in 48-well plates and transfected with 200 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-CRBN-WT and 15 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-IKZF1-WT or 15 ng of cDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-IKZF1-mutant. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were treated with DMSO (0.1%), thalidomide, or 5HT in culture medium at the indicated concentration for 18 h. For experiments using 5HP, the HEK293T-CRBN− cells were cultured in 48-well plates and transfected with 200 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-CRBN-WT, 15 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-AGIA-SALL4-WT, and 15 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-Myc-IKZF1-WT. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were treated with DMSO (0.1%), thalidomide, or 5HT in culture medium at the indicated concentration for 18 h. For all experiments, the cells were lysed by boiling in 1× sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 10% glycerol) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After the membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk (Megmilk Snow Brand) in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h, the appropriate antibody was used. Immobilon (Millipore) or ImmunoStar LD (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) was used as the HRP substrate, and the luminescence signals were detected using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini (GE Healthcare). To perform reprobing, stripping solution (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) was used, and the membranes were reblocked using 5% skim milk in TBST. The immunoblot data were analyzed by using ImageJ (version 2.0.0-rc-43/1.50e). Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
Samples from a laminated microbial mat at a geothermal pool (“Cone Pool”), located in the Little Hot Creek geothermal spring area within the Long Valley Caldera, California (37.6905833° N, 118.844417° W), were collected on the 15th of August 2015, under the umbrella of the Microbial Dark Matter (MDM) Phase II study, an extension of the Genomic Encyclopaedia of Bacteria and Archaea MDM project (GEBA-MDM; [58]). An intact, submerged, dendrolitic cone, and the laminated mat beneath, was cored using a sterile drinking straw from the edge of the pool. The straw was shipped to the Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, on ice, and stored at 4 °C. Layers of the mat were delimited based on color and consistency, designated “A” through “I” by slicing through the straw using a sterile scalpel (Fig. 1). The layers “B” to “H” were extruded from the straw casing and divided for DNA extraction. a Overview of Cone Pool hot spring; b section through microbial mat, showing dendritic cones and layers of the mat; c delineation of layers of the mat; and d Sequencing workflow for single-cell genomics (left, layer C) and shotgun metagenomics (right, layers C, E, and H). The numbers at the bottom of the figure indicate the number of resulting high quality (HQ), medium quality (MQ) and low quality (LQ) genomes, as based on MISAG/MIMAG standards. DNA for metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was extracted from 0.25 g of each layer using the Xpedition™ Soil/Fecal DNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research Corp.), which uses bead beating based lysis previously shown to break capsids of dsDNA viruses [59]. The remainder of layer C was divided into replicates (~0.1–0.5 g each), submerged in 1 ml PBS, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged for 30 s at 2000 rpm. The 1 ml supernatant was then mixed with 100 µL of 0.2 μm filter sterilized GlyTE (20 ml 100× TE Buffer pH 8.0, 60 ml deionized water, 100 ml molecular grade glycerol), incubated at room temperature for 1 min, and then stored at −80 °C for downstream single-cell analysis. The 16S rDNA amplicons of the regions V4 and V5 were obtained using primers 515F-Y (5′-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5′-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) [60] sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer in 2 × 300 bp run mode. Amplicons from the layer D were not sequenced due to poor DNA amplification. The sequence analysis was performed on 3.6 × 105 (±1.1 × 105) sequences per sample using the JGI iTagger v2.0 pipeline [61] that cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTU) with 97% sequence similarity in the USEARCH software suite [62] and performs ecological analyses in QIIME [63] using RDP classifier v2.5 [64]. The purpose of 16S rDNA amplicon analysis was to select mat layers containing the highest abundance of understudied bacterial phyla [58] for subsequent shotgun metagenomic and single-cell genomic analysis. Genomic DNA from layers C, E, and H was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform (libraries with 300 bp inserts) at the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute in 2 × 150 bp mode resulting in 101 × 106, 63 × 106 and 83 × 106 reads from layers C, E, and H, respectively (JGI sequencing project Gold IDs: Gp0147099, Gp0147100 and Gp0147101, respectively). Reads were trimmed and screened for common laboratory contaminants with BBTools v.37 (Bushnell [65], http://bbtools.jgi.doe.gov) and the sequencing errors were corrected by bfc v.181 [66] with the following parameters: “-s 10 g -k 21”. Mate-pair reads were assembled using SPAdes v.3.10.0 [67] with specified kmers 21, 33, 55, 77 and -meta flag. The co-assembly of all three metagenomic datasets was annotated using the IMG system [68, 69] and is publicly available under IMG taxon ID 3300022548. Using the contigs of the combined assembly, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were created by combining initial sets of genome bins from seven different binning approaches: (1) MaxBin v1.4.5 [70] using the universal 40 marker gene set and (2) the 107 marker gene set; (3) MaxBin v2.2.4 [71] with default parameters; (4) MetaBAT1 v0.32.5 [72] using the “super-specific” parameter and (5) “super-sensitive” parameter; (6) MetaBAT2 v2.12.1 [73] using default parameters; and (7) CONCOCT v0.4.0 [74] using default parameters. All binning methods used a minimum contig size of 3000 bp. Bins generated using the seven methods were used as input to DAS Tool v1.1.0 [75], which was run with default parameters to generate the final MAG set. Single amplified genomes (SAGs) were generated from layer C at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. Briefly, single cells were isolated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), lysed with a combination of freeze-thawing and alkaline lysis, and genomic DNA was amplified with WGA-X [76]. Barcoded libraries were created using Nextera XT (Illumina) following standard protocols. Low-coverage shotgun sequencing (LoCoS) and de novo assembly was carried out at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences as previously described [76]. SAGs which had at least 50,000 trimmed reads, 1000 normalized reads, and a total assembly size of at least 50 kb from LoCoS were selected for deeper sequencing (n = 192). Deep sequencing of libraries was performed at the DOE Joint Genome Institute on the Illumina NextSeq platform in 2 × 150 bp mode. Raw reads were filtered for quality and contamination with BBTools v.37 (Bushnell [65], http://bbtools.jgi.doe.gov), then BBTools components BBNorm and Tadpole were used for read normalization and error correction prior to assembly with SPAdes (v3.9.0; --phred-offset 33 --sc -k 22,55,95 --12) [77]. After assembly, 200 bp was trimmed from contig ends, contigs <2 kbp in length or with read coverage <2 were discarded, and annotation was carried out according to IMG standard protocols [68, 69]. The overall quality of SAGs and MAGs was categorized according to published standards [78]. CheckM v1.0.8 using lineage-specific workflow [79] was used to estimate completeness and contamination. Genomes with more than 10% estimated contamination (n = 62) were excluded from further analysis. A set of 56 universal single-copy marker proteins [80, 81] was used to build a phylogenetic tree for the newly generated SAGs and MAGs and a representative set of bacteria and archaea based on all publicly available microbial genomes in IMG/M ([68]; genomes accessed in April 2018) and about 8000 MAGs from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB, [82], downloaded 18 October 2017). Marker proteins were identified with hmmsearch (version 3.1b2, hmmer.org) using a specific HMM for each of the markers. For every marker protein, alignments were built with MAFFT (v7.294b, [83]) and subsequently trimmed with BMGE using BLOSUM30 [84]. Single protein alignments were then concatenated resulting in an alignment of 10,866 sites. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred with FastTree2 using the options: -spr 4 -mlacc 2 -slownni -lg [85]. In the following step, a subtree was built that employed the above described methods but included only query genomes and reference genomes from query-genome containing clades in the initial tree. The genomes were classified at the phylum level using the naming system of the National Center for Biotechnology Information taxonomy [86]. In addition, all genomes were classified with the GTDB Toolkit v0.1.0 [87] according to the GTDB taxonomy, which was created to standardize microbial taxonomy according to genomic information [88]. Finally, all MAGs and SAGs were clustered by Mash v1.1 [89] using a 95% average nucleotide identity (ANI) cutoff to approximate a species-level resolution. VirSorter [3] and comparison to the IMG/VR database [6] were used to detect viral sequences in SAGs, MAGs, and the unbinned fraction of metagenomic contigs. VirSorter was used on all contigs at least 2 kb in length, retaining predictions from categories 1 and 2 (fully viral contigs), and 4 and 5 (integrated viruses). Contigs in which bitscores of pfam hits were higher than bitscores of viral hits were not considered as viral contigs. In the next step, all sequences were queried against the full IMG/VR database (version IMG_VR_2018-01-01_3) with BLAST [90]. Hits where alignment length was at least 70% of the query or subject sequence length (whichever was shorter) were retained (at the “detection” threshold, [91]), and all overlapping and adjacent hit regions of each query contig were merged into consensus coordinate range(s) with the R package plyranges [92]. Single best hits with at least 90% identity and 75% alignment coverage to IMG/VR were assigned with the IMG/VR Viral Cluster ID (“assignment” threshold, [91]); otherwise the contigs were annotated as a novel virus. Results from the two prediction approaches were combined to extract viral sequences. The coordinate range(s) predicted as viral by each method were merged with the R package plyranges [92], to obtain the most inclusive estimates of viral sequence. The final set of viral sequences was clustered with MUMmer v3.23 [93], requiring at least 95% ANI over at least 85% of the length of the shorter of the two sequences to add sequences to a cluster, in accordance to community standards [16]. An additional curation step was performed for viral contigs within MAGs in order to remove viral contigs erroneously binned together with a bacterial genome. For that reason, only integrated viruses containing flanking bacterial sequences (VirSorter categories 4 and 5) and viral contigs clustering with other integrated viruses were retained; otherwise they were assigned to the unbinned fraction which represented 40% of the reads. The host–virus pairings detected in SAGs and MAGs were tested for their consistency with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based linking prediction [94]. CRISPRs in host genomes were identified using CRT v1.1 [17] with script modifications as used in the IMG/M [68], CRISPRCasFinder [95] and CRISPRDetect [96] and 100% identical spacers detected by these three programs in the genomes belonging to the same hosts species (95% ANI) were de-replicated by cd-hit v4.8.1 [97] and matched against all viral genomes found in the Cone Pool using blastn [90], where only identical hits over the complete length of a CRISPR spacer were scored as a positive match. The host–virus genome coverage ratio was assessed by mapping the metagenomic reads from the layers C, E and H to a reference database containing host and virus genomes obtained in the previous steps by BBMap (Bushnell [65], https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) using the default settings. From the viruses that formed sequence-similarity clusters (see above), only the longest viral contig was selected as a cluster representative for mapping. From the host genomes grouped by ANI (see above), the genome with the highest genome completeness and the lowest contamination (estimated by CheckM) was selected as the cluster representative for mapping. The number of reads per sample used for mapping was normalized to the lowest number of reads per sample obtained for the three layers. Only the genomes with reads distributed across more than 75% of their genome length (“assignment” threshold, [91]) were considered as positive hits.
Tumor samples were taken from 72 patients with primary PDAC between January 1991 and January 2017 (stage I, n = 3; stage II, n = 38; stage III, n = 16; stage IV, n = 15). The clinicopathological variables evaluated are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Biopsies were taken after obtaining informed consent from the participants. This retrospective study was approved by the National Cheng Kung University Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB No: A-ER-106-027). The following clinical practice guidelines for pancreatic cancer were applied: In principle, resectable diseases are treated by surgery (Whipple operation or pylorus preserving pancreatoduodectomy) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unresectable tumors (locally advanced or metastatic disease) are treated with chemotherapy or supportive care. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and IHC staining were performed following the standard protocols. The primary antibodies used were anti-IL-20 (7E; diluted to 5 µg/ml), anti-IL-20R1 (Catalog number: ab203196; Abcam; 1:200 dilution), anti-IL-20R2 (Catalog: 14-1206, clone: 20RNTC; eBioscience™, Thermo Fisher Scientific; diluted to 5 µg/ml), anti-IL-22R1 (Catalog: MAB42941; Clone: # 496514; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; diluted to 5 µg/ml), anti-Ki-67 (Catalog: ab16667; Cone: SP6; Abcam; 1:200 dilution), anti-F4/80 (Catalog: ab6640; Abcam; 1:200 dilution), anti-CD-206 (Catalog: ab64693; Abcam; diluted to 1 µg/ml), anti-PD-L1 (Catalog: 17952-1-AP; Proteintech; 1:500 dilution), anti-CD8 (Catalog: ab217344; Abcam; 1:2000 dilution), anti-PD-1 (Catalog: ab214421; Abcam; 1:1000 dilution), anti-β-dystroglycan (Catalog: 11017-1-AP; Proteintech; 1:200 dilution), anti-ATGL (Catalog: #2138; cell signaling; 1:500 dilution), and anti-LIPE (Catalog: #OAAF00742; Aviva Systems Biology; 1:100 dilution). The secondary antibodies used were anti-human IgG (Catalog: 109-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500 dilution), anti-rabbit IgG (Catalog: 111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500 dilution), and anti-rat IgG (Catalog: 405405; clone: Poly4054; BioLegend; 1:500 dilution). The anti-IL-20 mAb 7E was generated using the standard protocols. 7E was confirmed to specifically recognize only IL-20, not any other members of the IL-10 family. This antibody was also validated to recognize both human and mouse IL-20 (ref. ). For quantification of Ki-67+ proliferating cells in the pancreases of KPC mice, H&E staining and image analysis software (ImmunoRatio; https://www.medfloss.org/node/410) were used. Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin, and images were acquired using a digital microscope camera (DP12; Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan). IHC images were acquired to measure the percentage of positively stained area for IL-20, PD-L1, αSMA, F4/80, CD206, CD8, and PD-1 in clinical samples and animal experiments. The percentage of positively stained area was calculated with the Tissue-Faxs software. Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to the protocols used for IHC analysis. The primary antibodies used were anti-IL-20 (7E) and anti-PD-L1 (Catalog: 17952-1-AP; Proteintech; 1:200 dilution). The secondary antibodies used were AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-human (Catalog: 109-545-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200 dilution) and AlexaFluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit (Catalog: 111-585-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200 dilution) antibodies. Primary pancreatic tumor cells were isolated from KPC mouse tumors. For bioluminescence imaging experiments, a luciferase-expressing derivative of primary KPC tumor cells (KPC-luc) was prepared by stably transfecting cells with pCAG-luc, which has the firefly luciferase gene encoded under the control of the (r)-actin promoter and the CMVIE enhancer, and a stable cell line was established. The KPC mice were maintained in C57BL/6J background with KrasG12D mutation and Trp53 ablation. KPC/Luc cells (2 × 106) were injected orthotopically into the pancreas of C57BL/6J and NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/YckNarl (ASID) mice, which were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center (NLAC; Taiwan). Bioluminescence and fluorescence images were acquired (IVIS 50; Xenogen, Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) to detect luminescence from the KPC/Luc cells. Using the same approaches as those described for the s.c. model, treatments were started on day 4 and ended 4 weeks after tumor inoculation. IL-20R1-deficient (IL-20R1−/−) mice were maintained on the C57BL/6J background. To evaluate the effects of 7E, KPC mice (n = 16 per group) and orthotopic model mice (n = 5 per group) were randomly assigned to the indicated groups and treated with PBS, 7E (6 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)), mIgG (6 mg/kg, i.p.), an anti-PD-1 mAb (200 μg/per mouse, i.p.; Catalog number: BE0146, BioXCell), or 7E (6 mg/kg, i.p.) plus the anti-PD-1 mAb (200 μg/per mouse) twice per week for the duration of the experiment. LLC cells (2 × 106 per mouse) were s.c. injected into the right flank of C57BL/6J WT mice. Six days after inoculation, the tumor-bearing mice were treated with PBS, 7E (6 mg/kg, i.p.), or mIgG isotype control (6 mg/kg, i.p.) twice per week for the duration of the experiment. Four weeks after inoculation, the tumors were harvested and weighed. All animal experiments and animal care were performed according to institutional guidelines at the Laboratory Animal Center of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and approved by the Affidavit of Approval of Animal Use Protocol of National Cheng Kung University (IACUC Approval No: 108118, 109071). IL-20 concentrations in mouse serum from tumor-bearing and healthy mice were measured using a mouse IL-20 ELISA Kit (Cat. Number: DY1204; R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells (4 × 103) were treated with human (h) IL-20 (200 ng/ml) for 72 h in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. To confirm the specific activity of IL-20, 7E (2 μg/ml) was added to cultures, either alone or with IL-20 at a 10:1 (7E:IL-20) ratio. The cells were then incubated with 1 mg/ml MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h, and the MTT–formazan crystals formed were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance was measured at 550 nm. KPC cells were infected with a lentivirus containing a pLKO1 plasmid that carried an IL-20R1-specific short hairpin RNA (shIL-20R1) sequence or nonsilencing shRNA construct (Ctrl) from RNA Technology Platform and Gene Manipulation Core (Academia Sinica, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours after the addition of the virus, stably transduced cells were selected by adding 2 mg/ml puromycin to the growth medium for 1 week, and then the surviving cells were collected for further applications. BMDMs were isolated from the tibias of WT C57BL/6 mice and treated with monocyte colony-stimulating factor (100 ng/ml) (PeproTech, Catalog number: 315-02) for 5 days to differentiate them into macrophage-lineage cells (M0-type macrophages). Macrophages (1 × 106) were treated with IL-20 (500–1000 ng/ml) for 48 h. To verify the neutralization of IL-20, 7E was added to the culture system, either alone or together with IL-20 at a 10:1 concentration ratio (7E:IL-20). Single-cell suspensions were prepared in ice-cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Catalog: UR-BSA004; Sigma) and 1% sodium azide (Catalog: S2002; Sigma). Cells (1 × 106) were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate–anti mouse F4/80 (macrophage marker; Catalog: 123107; clone: BM8; BioLegend; diluted to 2 µg/ml), allophycocyanin–anti CD-86 (M1-type macrophage marker; Catalog: 105011; clone: GL1; BioLegend; diluted to 2 µg/ml), and phycoerythrin–anti CD-206 (M2-type macrophage marker; Catalog: 141705; clone: C068C2; BioLegend; diluted to 5 µg/ml) at 4 °C for 60 min. The cells were washed three times and analyzed using a flow cytometry (FACS Canto II; BD Biosciences). FlowJo_V10 software was used for data acquisition and analysis. To examine the expression of PD-L1 and IFN-α, KPC cells were incubated with mIL-20 (400 ng/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 0, 8, 16, and 24 h. 7E was used to inhibit the activity of mIL-20. KPC cells were treated with mIL-20 (400 ng/ml), mIL-20 (400 ng/ml) plus 7E (4 μg/ml), mIL-20 (400 ng/ml) plus mIgG (4 μg/ml), or mIL-20 (400 ng/ml) plus an anti-IFN-α antibody (4 μg/ml) for 24 h, and then total mRNA was isolated and analyzed. For histopathological analysis, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the soleus muscle or the sizes of adipocytes in epididymal fat were analyzed. To quantify the CSA of the soleus muscle or the sizes of adipocytes in epididymal fat, five different fields were randomly chosen and analyzed using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The epididymal fat pads of mice were isolated, and adipocytes were cultured following a standard protocol. To test the effect of IL-20 on lipolytic gene expression, the adipocytes were cultured in differentiation medium (1 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 2.5 μM rosiglitazone, and 1 nM triiodothyronine) for 7 days and then incubated with mIL-20 (200 ng/ml) or 7E (2 μg/ml) for 24 h. To evaluate the effect of IL-20 on tumor-derived lipolytic factors, LLC cells were pretreated with mIL-20 (200 ng/ml) for 24 h. Then the medium was replaced with fresh medium without mIL-20. The conditioned medium was collected 24 h later and added to adipocyte cultures with 7E (2 μg/ml), mIgG (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen), rat IgG (2 μg/ml; BioLegend), or an anti-TNF-α antibody (2 μg/ml; BioLegend). Total RNA was isolated. Reverse transcription was performed with a reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was then amplified on a thermocycler (LightCycler 480; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) with SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics). The quantitative results for mRNA were normalized to the results for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the control housekeeping gene. Relative changes in mRNA expression were determined by the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Experimental data are presented as the mean ± SD/SEM. GraphPad Prism software was employed to process initial data and plot graphs. The endpoints analyzed were the survival of patients with low or high IL-20 expression and that of KPC mice treated with PBS, mIgG, or 7E, which were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier methods. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate analyses of disease prognosis. Pearson correlation analysis was used for evaluation of the relationship between IL-20 and PD-L1 in clinical specimens. Two-group comparisons were analyzed by a two-sided Student’s t test. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare data among groups in experiments including three or more groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001).
