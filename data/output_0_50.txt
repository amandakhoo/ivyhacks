The overall methodology is visually summarized in Fig. S1. The Gene-PARE was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Florida Radiation Oncology Group (Kerns et al. [3, 14]). All patients provided informed consent under the parent study – Gene-PARE, at Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai and Florida Radiation Oncology Group (Kerns et al. [3, 14]). We obtained access to anonymized individual level genotype data from Genetic Predictors of Adverse Radiotherapy Effects (Gene-PARE) (phs000772.v1.p1) via dbGaP’s authorized application, under the approval of North Texas Regional IRB protocol 2016–090. The study described here was performed under the North Texas Regional IRB (formerly the University of North Texas Health Science Center IRB), and was given “EXEMPT” status based on the criteria that our study involved data available from public repository, i.e. dbGaP and does not require approval of receiving informed consent. We analyzed prostate cancer individuals from the discovery set (N = 367), which were genotyped for 934,940 SNPs on Affymetrix® Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6.0. The dataset contains phenotypic information on prostate cancer patients who have received radiation treatment either via EBRT or brachytherapy. Out of three radiotoxicity phenotypes – erectile dysfunction, proctitis and urinary morbidity (IPSS/AUASS) – we focused our investigation on proctitis because (1) it is also prevalent in other pelvic region cancers [15] and (2) the data for proctitis was complete for all individuals. We extracted SNP data from the intensity (*.CEL) files using Affymetrix® Genotyping Console using the BIRDSEED v2 algorithm and genotype call rate of 95% and default settings from the array, leaving 905,280 markers and total of 355 individuals. The files were then exported to plink [16] format to perform QC measures as suggested by Anderson et al. [17]. At the individual-level filtering, we removed 5 individuals for either failing heterozygosity or having greater than 9% missing genotypes. At the IBD filter of 0.1875, we removed 29 individuals; further, 120 individuals were removed who were not of European ancestry or failed to cluster with the main patient population based on principal component (PC) analysis of PC1 and PC2 of the genetic data. After SNP-level filtering on SNP missingness, minimum allele frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we had 746,684 SNPs and 222 individuals. The final cohort characteristics after QC were analyzed using Fischer’s exact test for categorical variables and Student’s t-test for continuous variables (Table 1).
 Characteristics of individuals with prostate cancer who received radiotherapy Tissue specific gene expression prediction using each individual’s genotype profile was performed using PrediXcan [11]. Integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with genotype increases power to detect gene-based associations with phenotype of interest. The PrediXcan approach determines gene expression attributed to genetic variants, the aggregated effect of local (cis) genetic variants to the gene expression is tested for association with the phenotype. The PrediXcan model, derives weights of SNPs and tissue specific gene expression using lasso regression from GTEx [18] as reference dataset, including variance and covariance patterns based on linkage disequilibrium of cis-SNPs. We obtained model weights for prostate and whole-blood tissues for the GTEx-v7 reference panel, accessible at http://predictdb.org/; filename- GTEx-V7_HapMap-2017-11-29.tar.gz. In the GTEx (v7), there are 132 prostate tissue donors and 369 donors for whole-blood tissue. PrediXcan implements gene expression value prediction, followed by gene-based association. The z-scores identify the direction of expression [19] for each gene and their corresponding p-values for association testing. For prostate tissue, a total of 3113 gene and 5954 genes for whole-blood tissue were imputed for their tissue-specific gene expression based on genotype variation. Following association tests, significant genes (identified as p-value < 0.05) were investigated further by constructing tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks between query (significant genes) and interacting genes using the DifferentialNet [20] database and NetworkAnalyst3.0 [21]. The network was filtered on betweenness centrality of 4.0 in order to reduce isolated neighboring nodes (each gene is a node). All the genes in the network were subsequently analyzed for gene set enrichment using clusterProfiler [22] for gene ontology and visualized in GOPlot [23]. We identified the study by Oorschot et al. [24] as an external cohort for replication of our transcriptomic findings. Their study recruited 200 patients who received EBRT for prostate cancer. Prior to receiving treatment, whole blood was drawn, and lymphocytes were cultured, irradiating half of the cells with 2Gy gamma rays and other half left untreated followed by genome-wide microarray analysis. The data were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus - GSE85570 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85570). Further details of the study have been described elsewhere [24]. We used BART [25] and NCBI’s GEO2R to analyze differentially expressed genes between untreated and treated with 2 Gy of radiation groups. We tested the significance of genes overlapping our results from prostate and whole-blood tissue to those identified in the replication dataset using GeneOverlap (https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/geneoverlap) which applies Fisher’s exact test testing significant genes for whole blood tissue (n = 98), prostate tissue (n = 62) and replication cohort (n = 2973) against genome (n = 21,196) . The intensity (*.CEL) files of 222 individuals from the above QC protocol were extracted for copy number analysis using Affymetrix® Genotyping Console. Copy number segments were filtered to regions (minimum genomic size of 2 kbps) with 10 marker per segment [26]. The copy number data was exported as tab-delimited file for copy number association in CNVRuler [27]. CNV regions were significantly associated at FDR p-value < 0.05. The significant CNV regions were visualized using Phenogram [28] then mapped to genes using UCSC browser for GRCh37/hg19 assembly (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). The genes within CNV regions were analyzed for functional and diseases processes and visualized using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
The Tohoku Medical Megabank Community-Based Cohort (TMM CommCohort) study was designed and as previously described. Briefly, 20–75-year-old residents from Iwate and Miyagi, which are the Pacific coast prefectures in Northeast Japan, were recruited between May 2013 and March 2016. To control for unmeasured biases, individuals from Miyagi and Iwate were treated as separate sub-cohorts. Physiological, urine, and blood tests were conducted at the time of enrolment. The levels of GGT, AST, and ALT were measured using standardized clinical laboratory techniques based on the standard protocol of the Japan Society of Clinical Chemistry (JSCC). The medical history and lifestyles, including drinking habits, of the enrolled subjects were documented using self-administered questionnaires. In the questionnaires, current drinking status was defined in four categories: “current drinker (drinking more than once in a month)”, “former drinker”, “never (or almost never) drinker”, and “never drinker because of his/her predisposition to rejecting alcohol.” In this study, we treated only “current drinker” as a drinker, and others (i.e. “former drinker,” “never (or almost never) drinker,” and “never drinker because of his/her predisposition to rejecting alcohol”) as a non-drinker. Drinking frequency (drinking opportunity in a week) was reported by 6 categories: “less than 1 day/month”, “1–3 days/month”, “1–2 days/week”, “3–4 days/week”, “5–6 days/week”, and “every day.” We converted the answers into numeric values: 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, and 7 days/week, respectively. Weekly alcohol consumption (WAC) was denoted as the sum of ethanol content (g) for each type of beverages drunk in a week. The ethanol content of each type of alcoholic beverage was considered as follows: 180 ml sake (rice wine) as 23 g, 180 ml shochu (white spirits) as 36 g, 180 ml of chu-hai (cocktail using shochu) as 12.96 g, 633 ml beer as 23 g, 30 ml whisky as 10 g, and 100 ml wine as 12 g. The daily alcohol consumption (DAC) was calculated by dividing WAC by 7 days. The subjects were stratified by DAC into 5 tiers, based on standard US drinks (14 g alcohol): tier 0 (DAC (drinks/day) < 0.1); tier 1 (0.1 ≤ DAC < 1); tier 2 (1 ≤ DAC < 2); tier 3 (2 ≤ DAC < 3); tier 4 (3 ≤ DAC). We defined the alcohol consumption for non-drinkers as 0. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Iwate Medical University and Tohoku University. All participants provided written informed consent. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The procedure of genotyping and genotype imputation was performed as previously described. Briefly, 9966 participants in the TMM CommCohort study, enrolled in 2013, were genotyped using a HumanOmniExpressExome BeadChip Array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Subjects compatible with the following criteria were excluded from analysis: low call rate (< 0.99), sex-mismatch between questionnaire and genotype data, non-Japanese ancestry, or one of a close kinship pair (PI_HAT > 0.1875). The imputation of information on sex and the identification of close kinship pairs were conducted using the PLINK version 1.90b5.3. Variants with a low call rate (< 0.95), low Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium exact test P-value (P < 1 × 10–6), or low minor allele frequency (MAF; < 0.01) were also excluded. As a result, 1,127 individuals were removed, and 8839 subjects and 594,037 autosomal variants remained. After phasing by the SHAPEIT version 2.r900, imputation was conducted by Minimac3 version 2.0.1 using the 1,000 Genomes reference panel phase 3 as a reference. Variants with low-imputation quality (R2 < 0.8) were excluded. Finally, the remaining 7,129,678 variants were applied for subsequent analyses. Subjects who did not provide information on BMI, age, sex, alcohol consumption, or LT, such as AST, ALT, and GGT levels, were excluded. Additionally, subjects who had LT levels outside a range between a mean ± fourfold of standard deviation (SD), or who had a liver illness, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, liver cancer, or fatty liver disease, were also excluded. As a result, 983 individuals were excluded, and 7856 individuals remained. To perform a linear regression, GGT, AST, and ALT were log-transformed. We performed polymorphism × environment interaction analysis in the enrolled Miyagi and Iwate residents, respectively. The method of the interaction analysis was performed as previously described. Briefly, we fitted a linear regression model using a null hypothesis (H0), which lacked an interaction term, and an alternative hypothesis (H1), including interaction term, as follow:where Y is LT (AST/ALT ratio, or log-transformed GGT, AST or ALT), G is genotype variable, E is DAC (g/day) variable, β0 is the intercept, βG is the coefficient for variable G, βE is the coefficient for variable E, and βGE is the coefficient for the interaction between G and E. The interaction analysis was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and population structure in the genotype dataset (top 5 principal components [PCs] calculated using the PLINK software). The significance of the interaction term (βGE) was evaluated using the 1 df likelihood ratio test. The summaries of genome-wide interaction analysis for each prefectural population were applied for inverse-variant based meta-analysis using METAL (released on 2011-03-25). After genomic control correction, variants with P < 5 × 10–8 were considered as genome-wide significant. For our replication study, we used the pre-imputed dataset released by the TMM. Within this dataset, we used the subsets genotyped using Omni2.5 SNP array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) as well as the customized genotyping array designed by the TMM based on the Axiom platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), denoted as Japonica array version 2 (JPAv2). The genotyped data were pre-phased using SHAPEIT version 2 r837 and imputed using IMPUTE2 version 2.2.2 and 2KJPN with an allele frequency panel of ~ 2000 Japanese individuals. After conducting the same quality control with the main dataset, 4,935,024 and 5,686,147 variants in the JPAv2 and Omni2.5 datasets, respectively, were selected for further analysis. Replication analysis was conducted using the same exclusion criteria as those for the main analysis. Additionally, we excluded the Miyagi population in the subjects genotyped by JPAv2, because of small sample size (n = 678). The all subjects in the dataset genotyped by Omni2.5 belonged in the Miyagi population. Ultimately, 2791 and 1597 individuals for the JPAv2 and Omni2.5 dataset, respectively, were selected for replication analysis. The power calculation was conducted as previously reported. Briefly, we assumed that residuals of age-, sex-, and BMI-adjusted LT were distributed according to the following genetic model: LT = βEE + βG×E G × E, where variable E (alcohol consumption) was sampled from a normal distribution and variable G (genotype) was sampled according to assumed minor allele frequency (20% or 50%). The model parameters (βE) were estimated from the dataset used in the present study. βG×E was assumed to be 0.25- to 2.5-fold βE. We simulated data for E and G for the Iwate and Miyagi populations, performed inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, and recorded whether the interaction term achieved suggestive significance. This process was repeated for 1000 iterations to calculate the power of each parameter set. We estimated the genetic correlation and LD score regression intercept using LDSC version 1.0.1 and pre-computed LD scores for East Asians provided by the program developer. The LD score regression intercept was calculated using summary statistics. To estimate the genetic correlation between the LT traits, summary data from the published GWAS conducted in Japanese population were used. The statistical analysis for the identified variants was conducted using R (version 3.5.1). To determine the trend in quantitative traits, the Junckheere-Terpstra test was performed using clinfun (version 1.0.15). To calculate the adjusted LT, we added the mean LT to the residual in the linear regression adjusted by age, sex, BMI and genotype, as described in a previous study. The datasets analyzed in the current study are not publicly available for ethical reasons. However, they can be made available upon request after approval from the Ethical Committee of Iwate Medical University, the Ethical Committee of Tohoku University, and the Materials and Information Distribution Review Committee of the TMM Project.
As lymphoma samples contained both normal and tumour cells, we investigated promoter methylation using clonal bisulfite sequencing (see “Methods”). From bisulfite sequencing analysis (Fig. 2C), mouse lymphomas were largely unmethylated at the Tes promoter, although low-level, sporadic methylation was observed. It is improbable that this observed low level of methylation (< 5%), which was neither clonal, dense or present at specific CpG sites, is able to silence Tes transcription in mouse lymphomas. Therefore, we conclude that the observed reduction in Tes transcription in these lymphomas is not mediated via promoter methylation.
The plant responses to larval feeding (Fig. 3b, F vs. C, up) involved similar phytohormonal GS as the responses to the eggs. They included strong up-regulation of JA-, SA-, ABA- and ET-related GS in most plant–insect combinations. The only exception was S. dulcamara, which showed strong up-regulation of JA-related GS, but clear down-regulation of ABA-, SA- and ET-related GS (Fig. 3b, F vs. C, down), which could indicate a weaker inducible response to larval feeding in this species, which maintains a quite effective constitutive defence due to its high content of steroidal alkaloids. Alternatively it might be a side effect of weaker feeding damage in the experimental setup used (see “Methods” section, Additional evaluation of Solanum dulcamara transcriptome data). In general, more AUX-related GS were up-regulated in response to feeding than in response to eggs.
GTEx is a well-established resource database with which biomedical researchers investigate the genetic genotypes and gene expression relationships of different human individuals. The current-release (V8) GTEx datasets were obtained from the GTEx data portal website (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets). The most recent GTEx dataset contains 54 different human tissue types and 17,382 samples from 948 donors. The most abundant tissue (musculoskeletal) has 803 RNA-seq samples, whereas kidney-medulla tissue has only four RNA-seq samples. Sample sizes vary considerably between tissues. Brain tissue has 13 tissue subtypes in the GTEx collection. GENCODE 26 was the annotation standard for this version of the GTEx data release, and the alignment of GTEx RNA-seq was performed using the STAR pipeline. The transcript expression TPM data were used for analysis, and transcript-level quantifications were calculated using RSEM v1.3.0 according to the GTEx web site. We obtained the transcript TPM expression data file (GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RSEMv1.3.0_transcript_tpm.gct.gz), and the total number of transcripts was 199,324, which were assigned to 58,219 human genes. We initiated the study by first remove 5,178 non-expressed transcripts from the 199,324 transcripts. In this study, we defined all expressed transcripts under the same Ensembl gene ID as alternatively spliced transcript isoforms. We further defined protein-coding transcripts and genes by the Biotype feature. Therefore, there are 145,571 transcripts assigned to 19,591 protein-coding genes, and the remaining 48,575 transcripts were assigned to 33,948 noncoding genes. The GTEx transcript TPM expression data file was initially processed using Python scripts, and the transcript expression data were stored separately based on different tissue types. We classified the transcript types according to the biotype labels. Protein-coding genes were defined by their protein-coding transcripts comprised. The top-ranked expressed transcript isoform was investigated to increase understanding of the transcript isoforms and their functional implications. The average expression information of each transcript isoform in protein-coding genes was used to rank the transcript isoforms by expression level, and CDS lengths or transcript lengths were used if the expression levels were identical. The expression characteristics of various ranked transcript isoforms were then examined. GraphPad Prism software (version 8.4) was used for part of the data analysis and graph data illustration (https://www.graphpad.com). Python and R packages (wilcox.test; t.test) were used for all statistical analyses, including data preprocessing and descriptive analysis (partial python scripts were listed in the supplementary file). Inferential analyses were also performed, including the Mann–Whitney U test, to examine the differences in transcript isoform expression between protein-coding genes as described previously. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. The variance between the transcript ranking among 54 different tissues was calculated based on the coefficient of variation (CV value) of all transcript isoforms in each tissue to analyze whether transcript isoforms in protein-coding genes exhibited tissue-specific expression profiles. We then identified putative significant Rank1 switch event genes by the rank1 TPM CV value cutoff as well as the numbers of rank1 tissues in all protein-coding genes (50 to 53 tissue counts). GLRX2, SPDYE3, PITPNB and ALDH18A1 genes were randomly selected as examples. The NCBI RefSeq gene and transcript ID were retrieved and extracted from the gene2ensembl file downloaded from NCBI web site. We utilized the Ensembl gene ID and RefSeq transcript ID (NM_xxxxxx) as the reference key ID. The MANE.GRCh38.v0.9.summary.txt file was obtained from the NCBI website. The MANE-select transcript information was extracted and compared with the GTEx dataset. We utilized the Ensembl gene ID and transcript ID as the comparison reference. There are 15,529 MANE-select gene and transcript records, and matched gene ID and transcript ID between MANE-select and GTEx v8/GENCODE 26 dataset were retried for analysis. In total, 15,529 genes with matched gene ID were found in both datasets. We further compared the MANE-select transcripts in the matched gene records. The web database server presented in this study is running in the Docker environment and operates on CentOS 7.x Linux. It was implemented on an Apache webserver with PHP in conjunction with the MySQL database for data as described previously. Access to our web database is free with no restriction or login account required. All data on the webserver are stored in a flat file format and loaded in our MySQL database for visualization. The D3 javascript library is used for summary data presentation and to enhance the interactive user-friendly interface. All transcript isoform ranking information is publicly available at https://tregt.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/index.php . In addition, the top-ranked expressed transcripts (Rank1 to Rank10) are available for download from the website.
To identify functional clusters of genes and biological pathways that are over-represented in the sequencing data of the skin lesions of UCL and NUCL patients, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed as explained in “Methods” section. The enriched GSEA pathways were classified into five main clusters (Fig. 3a–c). Among these, several pathways involved in innate and inflammatory responses were noted. This includes Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, with “TIR-domain-containing adapter molecule (TICAM1)-mediated TLR4 signaling”, “TLR3 cascade”, “TLR4 cascade”, “TLR7/8 cascade”, “TLR9 cascade”, “MyD88-independent TLR4 cascade”, “MyD88 dependent cascade initiated on endosome”, “Trafficking and processing of endosomal TLR”, and “Diseases associated with the TLR signaling cascade”.
The study was approved by the human research ethics committee of UCSF (11-07922) and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and a waiver of informed consent was granted as no study procedures were performed. Microdissection of tumor tissue was performed from archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue and DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedures. DNA sequencing libraries were prepared with KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPA Biosciences, Wilmington, MA p/n KK8504) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A custom-designed bait library was used to target the coding regions of 480 cancer related genes (Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Choice, p/n 06588786001). Select introns including those of ALK, BRAF, MET, NTRK1, NTRK3, RET, and ROS1 were also targeted. Sequencing was performed as paired-end 100 bp reads on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequence analysis was performed as previously described. Written informed consent for publication of photographs was obtained.
The reference proteome for SARS-CoV-2 consists of 14,221 8-mers and 14,207 9-mers, that result in 9827 distinct 8-mers and 9814 distinct 9-mers (see Table S1). The 8-mers and 9-mers are generated by using a sliding window, moving one amino acid at a time, resulting in overlapping linear peptides. The reference human proteome, on the other hand, consists of 11,211,806 peptides that are 8-mers and 11,191,459 peptides that are 9-mers, resulting in 10,275,893 unique 8-mers and 10,378,753 unique 9-mers. Including alternatively spliced variants increases the unique peptide counts to 11,215,743 8-mers and 11,342,401 9-mers. Thirty-one 8-mer peptides and two 9-mer peptides are identical between the reference proteomes of SARS-CoV-2 and humans, after including alternatively spliced variants (Fig. 1b, Table S2). For comparison, we analyzed the protein sequences from 9434 viral species (taxons) from NCBI RefSeq (see “Methods”). On average, around 45.57 unique 8-mer/9-mers per viral taxon were shared with the human proteome (mean = 45.57, median = 12, SD = ±135.38). In order to control for the complexity and constraints of the amino acid sequences, we also analyzed the distribution of mimicked 8-mers/9-mers normalized by the total number of unique 8-mers/9-mers present in each viral taxon. On average, a fraction of 0.002 8-mers/9-mers out of all the unique 8-mers/9-mers in the virus are identical between the viral proteome and the human proteome (mean = 0.002, SD = ±0.011) (Fig. 1, Supplemental Fig. 1). The fraction of 33 human-mimicking 8-mers/9-mers is proximal to the mean. Overall, this suggests that the presence of 33 human-mimicking 8-mers/9-mers in SARS-CoV-2 is not surprising compared to the number of human-mimicking 8-mers/9-mers present in other viruses. In SARS-CoV-2, no 10-mer or longer peptides are identical between the pathogen and the host reference proteins. Of these, 29 peptides (8-mer/9-mer) mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 map onto nine of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 29 of the 20,350 human proteins. By including alternative splicing, the 33 8-mers/9-mers mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 map onto 39 of the 100,566 protein splicing variants. That is, 0.16% of the human proteins and 0.04% of all the known splicing variants have 8-mer/9-mer peptides that are mimicked by the SARS-CoV-2 reference proteome. Given that MHC Class I alleles typically engage peptides that are 8–12 mers, the analysis that follows was restricted to mapping host–pathogen mimicry from an immunologic perspective across 8-mer and 9-mer peptides only. Of the 33 peptides from SARS-CoV-2 that mimic the human reference proteome, 20 peptides are not found in any previous human-infecting coronavirus (SARS, MERS, or seasonal HCoVs) (Table 1). The UniProt database was used to download the 14 protein reference sequences for SARS-CoV. The non-redundant set of protein sequences from other coronavirus strains (HCoV-HKU1:188; HCoV-229E: 246; HCoV-NL63: 330; HCoV-OC43: 910; and MERS: 681) was computed by removing 100% identical sequences, and the remnant sequences were all included in the comparative analysis with SARS-CoV-2 mimicked peptides. A Venn diagram depicting the overlap of mimicked peptides across different human coronaviruses was generated (Fig. 1c). SARS-CoV-2 peptides mimicking human proteins, with experimental evidence of positive MHC binding from the immune epitope database.

The lengths of the human proteins mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 were considered to examine any potential bias towards the larger human proteins (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). For instance, human Titin (TTN), despite containing 34,350 amino acids and being of the longest human proteins, does not have even one peptide mimicked by SARS-CoV-2. The longest and shortest human proteins that are mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 are MICAL3 (length = 2002 amino acids) and BRI3 (length = 125 amino acids), respectively. The sequence conservation of each mimicked peptide was derived from all the 46,513 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in the GISAID database (as on 06/13/2020). The immune epitope database (IEDB) was used to examine the experimentally established, in vitro evidence for MHC presentation against human or SARS-CoV antigens. The peptides of potential immunologic interest were identified from the IEDB database using the following pair of assays. One of the assays involved purification of specific MHC-class I alleles and estimating the Kd values of specific peptide–MHC complexes through competitive radiolabeled peptide binding. The other assay uses mass spectrometry proteomic profiling of the peptide–MHC complexes, where the MHC complexes were purified from the cell lines specifically engineered to produce mono-allelic MHC class I molecules. The identity of the peptide sequence bound to the class-I MHC molecules was elucidated using mass spectrometry. A distribution of RNA expression across all the expressing samples collected from GTEx, Gene expression omnibus, TCGA, and CCLE is created. In this distribution, a high-expression group is defined as the set of samples associated with the top 5% of expression level. Enrichment score captures the significance of the token in the high-expression group. The significance is captured based on Fisher’s test along with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. During the comparison of gene expression across tissue types in GTEx, the specificity of expression is computed using “Cohen’s D”, which is an effect size used to indicate the standardized difference between two means. We analyzed the protein sequences from 9434 viral species (taxons) from NCBI RefSeq (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/). On average, around 45.57 unique 8-mer/9-mers per viral taxa were detected to be identical to a known human protein (mean = 45.57, median = 12, SD = ±135.38). The highest number of identical peptides were detected in Pandoravirus dulcis virus with 4423 peptides having an exact identical match to one or more human proteins.
The Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and ibm1-4 (SALK_035608C) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Ohio State University). The edm2-2 (SALK_014520), edm2-3 (SALK_114312) [14], transgenic complementation lines (E2pro:HA-E2c) [21] and Oy1 [34] were described previously. The Col-0 suvh4 suvh5 suvh6 triple mutant (suvh456) was kindly provided by Dr. Judith Bender (Brown University, Providence, RI). All Arabidopsis mutants used in this study are in Col-0 background. All Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on soil or half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) solid medium containing 1% (w/v) sucrose in a growth chamber (16-h day, 8-h night, 22°C; 100 μE m-2s-1). Aerial parts of 2-week-old plants were harvested from 1/2 MS solid plates and used for total RNAs isolation. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) and treated with TURBO DNA-freeTM kit (Ambion, Life Technology, Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was conducted by Maxima reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 100 pmol of oligo (dT)18. qRT-PCR was performed with the CFX Connect detection system (Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Actin8 was served as an internal control. All the primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in S10 Table. The growth condition, propagation and application of H. arabidopsidis isolate Hpa-Emoy2 were described previously [69]. Two-week-old seedlings were spray-inoculated with spore suspensions (3–5 × 104 spores/mL) using Preval sprayers (Preval, Coal City, IL, USA). The extent of infections was determined by counting visual sporangiophores at 7 dpi. The 3’ RACE were carried out using the GeneRacerTM kit (Life Technologies, Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s instruction. All primers used for RACE are listed in S10 Table. Aerial parts of 2-week-old plants were harvested from 1/2 MS solid plates and two grams of seedlings per sample were used for Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. ChIP was performed as descried previously [18] using anti-H3K9me2 (ab1220, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-H3 C-terminal (61277, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and anti-HA (AB9110, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies. All the antibodies are commercially available and were previously successfully used in Arabidopsis [18, 43]. All primers used for ChIP-qPCR are listed in S10 Table. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using NEBNext UltraTM II DNA library prep kit for Illumina (E7645, New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 generating 75 bp -single-end sequence reads. For each Chip-seq library, raw reads quality was first analyzed using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and any base with a quality score below 25 or N was trimmed using Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle). Trimmed reads were then mapped to the A. thaliana genome (TAIR 10) using BWA 0.7.15-r1140 with mem option default parameters [70]. See S11 Table for read statistics. Uniquely mapped reads were further filtered for calculating H3K9me2 coverage in transcripts, while unfiltered reads were used for calculating H3K9me2 coverage in transposable elements. The number of reads mapped to each transcript was determined using BEDTools v2.25.0 [71], and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between biological replicates. To compare H3K9me2 level between WT and edm2-2 samples, non-expressed transcripts with coverage value below 1 in all libraries were removed. Transcripts representing differentially methylated regions were determined using DEseq2 in R [72] with a P-adjusted value of 0.05 and a 1.2 fold change. Total RNAs were isolated from two-week-old plants grown in 1/2 MS solid plates using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of total RNA were treated with TURBO DNA-freeTM kit (Ambion, Life Technology, Invitrogen) to eliminate the genomic DNA contamination. Five micrograms of DNA-free total RNA was treated with Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Reagents (Plant Leaf)(Epicentre, USA) to remove Ribosomal RNA. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using NEBNext UltraTM Directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina (E7420, New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform generating 2×75 bp pair-end sequence reads. After sequencing, the quality of raw reads was analyzed using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The first 10 bases and the last base were trimmed. Contaminating adaptor reads, reads that were unpaired, bases below 25 and Ns, and reads shorter than 18 bases are also filtered using Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle). All trimmed reads were mapped to A. thaliana genome (TAIR 10) using HISAT2 v2.1.0 [73] with a known splice site file, built from Araport annotation file v11, and strand information parameter,—rna-strandness RF. See S11 Table for mapping statistics. Uniquely mapped reads were further filtered for calculating coverage in transcripts, while unfiltered reads were used for calculating coverage in transposable elements. Coverage values for each transcript were calculated using BEDTools with–split, -D, and -S parameters [71]. Spearman correlation coefficients between biological replicates were calculated and differentially expressed transcripts were determined using DEseq2 [72] with a P-adjusted value of 0.05 and a 1.2 fold change. RNA-seq raw data for ibm1-6 and the corresponding WT were obtained from NCBI (GEO: GSE93024) and processed using the same parameters described above. For genome browser tracks, read coverage per nucleotide is calculated using BEDTools. Coverage values were then normalized per million mapped reads. Genome tracks were displayed in IGV (Integrative Genome Viewer) [74]. For HA-tagged EDM2 samples, signals from biological replicates were first combined, and background signal measured by input sample analysis was subtracted from edm2-2 and WT samples. To visualize HA-EDM2 associated areas, signals from WT were further subtracted from edm2-2 signals. Genome browser tracks for suvh456 RNA-seq data were obtained from NCBI (GEO: GSE111609) [75]. The proportion of TE distribution was calculated based on the ratio of TE family size divided by the total size of TEs present in each category. Significant differences between the proportion of EDM2-controlled TEs and the proportion of TEs within the chromosome arms or pericentromeric regions was determined using annotation from Kawabe et al. [76] and the Fisher exact test. In order to correctly use the Fisher exact test, we randomly distributed an equal number of TEs 1,000 times within either the chromosome arms or pericentromeric regions and reported the average P-value for all re-sampling in Fig 4D and 4E. 165 NLR genes and non- NLR genes (28,610) are from the Arabidopsis TAIR10 annotation. Using bedmap, we calculated the cumulative length of TE annotation (from TAIR10) present in the surrounding area of the genic mRNA from 0 to 1,000 bp with a step of 100 bp. Statistical significance was tested using an ANOVA test by randomly re-sampling 1,000 time 165 non- NLR genes and reported the average P-value. Bacterial growth and inoculation were performed as previously described [77]. Two-week-old plants were sprayed with Pst DC3000 suspension containing 2 × 108 cfu/mL in 10 mM MgCl2 with 0.04% silwet L-77. Leaves were harvested at 3 hrs, 2 dpi and 3 dpi. Each leaves sample was weighed, surface sterilized in 70% ethanol for 30 s and washed in sterile distilled water for 30 s before ground in 10 mM MgCl2. Serial dilutions were plated on King’s B plates with appropriate antibiotics. Each data point represents the average of three replicates. Each replicate contains the bacterial titer of average of three individual pots with a density of 20 seedlings. Anti-HA beads were used to pull-down HA-EDM2 fusion protein after chromatin precipitation. The protein samples were trypsin-digested and analyzed with a MudPIT method described previously [78] with some modifications. MS1 scan range was m/z 400 to 1,400, and charge state was 2–6. For the MS2 scan, Orbitrap resolution was set at 15,000. A top speed mode with 2-sec and least-intense was used for both CID and HCD scanning. The decision-tree was targeted to a specific m/z in its inclusion list. The raw MS files were processed and analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v2.2 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Both Sequest HT and Mascot search engines were used to match all MS data to the Arabidopsis TAIR10 protein database supplemented with common contaminant proteins such as keratins.
Wild type and Nlrx1-/- C57/BL6 mice (7–12 weeks of age) were utilized for both fungal burden and survival studies in chemotherapeutic, Ly6G/C+ depletion, Ly6G+ depletion, and steroid treatment models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and immuno-competent model of pulmonary challenge. Mice were inoculated with resting conidia from A. fumigatus isolate AF293 or CEA10 using an aerosolization chamber as described in Sheppard et al [56] (2 exposures of 6 mL using a 1 x 109 conidia / mL). Conidia were also delivered via non-invasive tracheal instillation (1 X 107 conidia in 25 μL) for a subset of the studies where specified. In the chemotherapeutic model, mice were immunosuppressed 3 days prior to inoculation using an IP injection of cyclophosphamide (250 mg/kg) and a subcutaneous injection of cortisone acetate (250 mg/kg). Fungal burden and immune response were determined on day 3 post inoculation. For survival studies, mice received a second immuno-suppressive regime (IP injection of cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and a subcutaneous injection of cortisone acetate (250 mg/kg) on day 3 post inoculation and were monitored a minimum of twice daily for 14 days post inoculation. In the Ly6G/Ly6C+ or Ly6G+ depletion model, mice were immunosuppressed 1 day prior to inoculation using an IP injection of RB6-8C5 or A18 antibody (80 μg/ 20 g) respectively. Fungal burden and immune response were determined on day 3 post inoculation. For survival studies mice received a second treatment of antibody on day 3 post inoculation and were monitored a minimum of twice daily for 14 days post inoculation. In the steroid model, mice were immunosuppressed 3 days prior to inoculation using a subcutaneous injection of cortisone acetate (250 mg/kg). Statistical significance for fungal burden studies was determined by the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance for survival studies was determined by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. For adoptive transfer in an irradiated mouse, mice were irradiated 4 days prior to inoculation with 2 doses of 900 rads approximately 6 hours apart. Within 18 hours mice were replenished with fresh extracted bone marrow from immuno-competent mice via tail vein injection. Mice were allowed to recover for 6–8 weeks and then inoculated with 1 X 107 conidia in 25 μL via non-invasive tracheal instillation injection. Mice were monitored twice days for 14 days post inoculation. For adoptive transfer in NRG mice (NOD.Cg-Rag1
Il2rg/SzJ), cultured wild type and Nlrx1-/- CD103+ DCs were injected via subcutaneous injection (5 X 106 cells in 200 μL) post inoculation. For induction of neutropenia, a subcutaneous injection of Ly6G specific antibody (clone 1A8) was given one day prior to and three days post inoculation. For neutralization of IL-4, a subcutaneous injection of anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody (200 μg/ 100 μL Clone 11B11) was given one day prior to and three days post inoculation. Mice were monitored twice daily for 14 days post inoculation. Statistical significance was determined by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Mouse lungs were harvested on day three post inoculation and homogenized by mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. 20 mg of total tissue was utilized for genomic DNA extraction using the Omega EZNA SP fungal DNA mini kit (D5542-02). Purified genomic DNA 500 ng was analyzed via qPCR using TaqMan assay specific for A. fumigatus 18s rDNA [57]. Forward Primer: 5’-GGCCCTTAAATAGCCCGGT-3’. Reverse Primer: 5’- TGAGCCGATAGTCCCCCTAA-3’. Taqman probe: 5’-/56-FAM/AGCCAGCGGCCCGCAAATG/3IABLFQ/-3’ (IDTDNA). Statistical difference was determined using a Mann-Whitney U test. To obtain and remove cells from the bronchoalveolar space, the trachea was cannulated postmortem using a gavage needle. Lungs were washed three times with 1 ml of room-temperature PBS that were subsequently combined. Protein transport inhibitor (BD #554724) was added after combination of three washes. Lungs inoculated with the CEA10 isolate were perfused with 5 mL of PBS. Lungs were chopped into small pieces and enzymatically digested at 37°C for 45 min. Red blood cells were eliminated by hypotonic lysis followed by filtration through a 70μM cell strainer. Remaining cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.09% sodium azide. 6x105 cells per well were plated into 96 well plates. Non-specific antibody binding was prevented through incubation with anti-CD16/anti-CD32 (BD #553142) prior to extracellular staining. Cells were incubated with a mixture of extracellular antibodies for 20 minutes at 4°C. Panel 1 contained: anti-CD45 (eBioscience #47-0451-82), anti-MHCII (eBioscience #13-5321-82), anti-CD11b (BD # 557960), anti-CD11c (BD #550261), anti-Ly6C (eBioscience #45-5932-82), anti-Gr1 (eBioscience #25-5931-82), anti-F4/80 (eBioscience #15-4801-82), anti-CD103 (BD #557494), and anti-SiglecF (BD #552126). Panel 2 contained: anti-CD45 (eBioscience #47-0451-82), anti-CD4 (eBioscience #56-0041-82), anti-CD8 (eBioscience # 45-0081-82), anti-CD3 (eBioscience #15-0031-83), anti-NK1.1 (eBioscience 25-5941-82). Panel 1 was incubated for 20 minutes with Streptavidin PE-CF594 (BD #562318) after centrifugation and wash. Panel 1 was then fixed in Cytofix Fixation Buffer (BD #554655). Panel 2 was fixed and permeabilized after extracellular staining with fixation/permeabilization buffer (eBioscience #00-5123-43 and 00-5223-56). Cells were incubated with intracellular antibodies, anti-IFNγ (BD #554412), anti-IL17 (BioLegend #506915), anti-IL12 (p40/p70) (BD #554480), and/or anti-IL4 (eBioscience #11-7042-82) with permeabilization buffer. Cell phenotype analysis was performed in FACS Diva with the following gating discrimination: 1) live cells based of FS vs SS, 2) doublet exclusion based on FSC-H vs FSC-W and SSC-H vs SSC-W, and 3) selection of CD45+ events. Thirty thousand CD45+ events were acquired with a LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). CD45+ cells were then analyzed for cell phenotype. Flow cytometry gating strategy is shown in S2 Fig. Cells were extracted from Nlrx1-/- and wild type male mice between 15–25 weeks of age. Bone marrow derived CD103+ dendritic cells were cultured as previously described by [58]. In brief, cells were extracted from bone marrow in a sterile manner, subjected to hemolysis, filtered, washed in PBS and RMPI, and resuspended in RPMI media containing 10% FBS and Penn/Strep. Cells were diluted to a final concentration of 1 X 106 cells / 1 mL. GM-CSF and FLT3L were added to final concentrations of 5 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL respectively and incubated for 9 days at 37°C in the presence of 5% carbon CO2. Cells were supplemented on day 5 with fresh media containing GM-CSF/FLT3L. On day 9, non-adherent/loosely adherent cells were harvest and plated in fresh media in either a 24-well format for in vitro studies or new T-75 flasks for in vivo studies. Cells were harvested on day 16 for use. Detection and quantification of secreted chemokines and cytokines were performed as described by the manufacturer (BioLegends, LEGENDplex, Mouse Inflammation Panel 740150, Mouse Proinflammatory Chemokine Panel 740007, Human Inflammation Panel 740118, Human Proinflammatory Chemokine Panel 740003). In brief, cell supernatant (500 μL) from pre- and post-challenge samples was harvested, centrifuged (10 min 5,000 x g), aliquoted (100 μL), and stored at -80°C. Procedures were conducted in a provided 96-well vacuum filtration plate using vacuum filtration device. Wells were pre-wet with 100 μL of 1X wash buffer for 1–2 min. A gentle vacuum was applied (5–10 sec) to drain buffer. Aliquots of samples (25 μL) or standards (25 μL) were incubated with 25 μL of assay buffer, and immune-bead solution (25 μL) for 2 hrs at room temperature (21–23 °C), shaking (~300 rpm) in the dark in a sealed plate. A gentle vacuum was applied to drain unbound molecules. Wells were washed with 200 μL of 1X wash buffer and a gentle vacuum was administered. The wash procedure was repeated. Detection antibody (25 μL) was added to each well and incubated at room temp, in the dark, for 1 hr shaking (~300 rpm) in a sealed plate. SA-PE (25 μL) was then added to each well and incubated at room temp in the dark, shaking (~300 rpm) in a sealed plate for 30 min. Samples were washed twice using 200 μL of 1X wash buffer and a gentle vacuum. Samples were suspended in 200 μL of 1X wash buffer and transferred to FACS analysis tubes containing 300 μL of 1X wash buffer. Samples were immediately analyzed via flow cytometry (LSR II). Approximately 8,000 gated events (large and small beads) were analyzed per sample or standard. Geometric mean fluorescence was determined for each distinct bead population using FLowJo(v10). Experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated independently, N = 6–8. Statistical difference was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Wild type and Nlrx1 deficient BEAS-2B airway epithelial cells and bone marrow derived CD103+ DCs (500,000 per well, 24-well format) were challenged with fungal PAMPs curdlan (100 ng/mL, InvivoGen), zymosan depleted (100 ng/mL, InvivoGen), zymosan (100 ng/mL, InvivoGen), and dead or living Af293 conidia (500,000 per well in 10 μL) for 3–12 hours at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 and harvested in NP-40 lysis buffer (250 μL) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and stored at -80°C until use. For specific experiments, cells were pre-incubated for 3 hours with BIRB 796 (100 nM) or JNK-IN-8 (10 nM). Loading Buffer (6x, 50 μL) was added to each sample and samples were heat denatured at 100°C for 10 minutes. Samples (20 μL) were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, run at 100V for 1.5 hrs and transferred onto nitro-celluloses using a wet transblotter (constant amperage at 0.35A, 1.5 hrs) in the presence on an ice block. Membranes were blocked in 3% BSA TBS-T and standard 3x wash procedure was followed. Primary, monoclonal antibodies were added at a concentration of (1:4000–1:20,000) and secondary antibodies were added at a concentration of (1:10,000–1:20,000). Membranes were developed using a Bio-rad ChemiDOC XRS+ with sequential exposure every 10 seconds from 10–600 seconds. ELISA 96-well Plates for IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, and IL-4 were setup and run according to the manufactures protocol (Biolegend). In brief, capture antibody was diluted in 100 μL of the diluted capture antibody solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Plates were then brought to room temperature and washed 4 times with a 0.05% PBS/Tween solution using an microplate washer. 200 μL of room-temperature 1X assay diluent A was then added to block non-specific binding. Plates were then sealed and incubated at room temperature while shaking. After the 1-hour incubation, the plate was again washed 4 times. Standards and samples were also added in triplicate. Plates were then sealed and incubated overnight in 4°C with shaking. Plates were then washed 4 times, and 100 μL of the diluted detection antibody solution was added to each well. Plates were then sealed and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with shaking. After the incubation, plates were washed 4 times and 100 μL of the diluted avidin-HRP solution was added to each well. Plates were again sealed and incubated for 1 hour with shaking at room temperature. Plate were then washed 5 times and 100 μL of the substrate C solution was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 30 minutes in the dark and 100μL a stop solution of 2N H2SO4 was added. Plates were read at 450 nm and 570 nm within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution. All animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. All protocols involving animals were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) and are in compliance with Public Health Service Policy (PHS). Approval Numbers: 16–085, 16–011, 16–130, 18–252, 19–013. Mice were humanely euthanized using fatal plus solution (immunological studies) or carbon dioxide induced narcosis followed by an approved secondary form of euthanasia.
The undifferentiated ATC cell lines ARO and FRO were initially obtained from the Chinese Academy of Medical Science. All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ZETA, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were used throughout the experiment. The TC tissue microarrays were obtained from Shanghai Outdo Biotech Company (Shanghai, China). Each array contained TC tissues and adjacent TC tissues from a total of 62 cases. As described previously [18], IHC staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue microarrays were incubated at 4 °C for overnight with anti-GRP78 polyclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The immunoreactivity proportion was classified based on the percentage scores as < 5% (0), 5%–25% (1), 25–50% (2), 50–75% (3), and > 75% (4). The staining intensities based on intensity scores were classified as negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The final score was obtained by multiplying the percentage scores with the intensity scores. The total scores that ranged from 0 to 4 were defined as low group, and those that ranged from 5 to12 were defined as high group. The lentivirus-mediated small interference RNA for GRP78 (siGRP78) and the negative control RNA (siNC) were designed and synthesized by Genepharma (Shanghai, China). The GRP78 siRNA sequence was: F: 5-GGUACUGCUUGAUGUAUGUTT-3, R: 5-ACAUACAUCAAGCAGUACCTT 3. The control siRNA sequence was: F: 5-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3, R: 5-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3. For transfection experiments, the cells of ARO and FRO were plated in 6-well plates and siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for 24 h. The efficiency of gene silencing was further confirmed by western blotting in both the cell lines. ARO and FRO cells at a density of 3 × 105 cells/mL in a total volume of 3 mL were seeded in 6-well plates. After inoculation for 24 h, different concentrations of TM (0–1 μg/mL) were added and the cells were cultured for another 72 h. A parallelly untreated culture with same passage number as that of the adapted cultures was maintained as control culture, and the level of ER stress was further confirmed by western blotting in both the cells. The cells were collected, the total protein was prepared in RIPA buffer (medium, Beyotime, China), and the cytoplasmic proteins were obtained using the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (P0028, Beyotime, China). Western blotting was performed as described previously [20]. The antibodies used for western blotting were PERK, XBP1s and CLO1A1 (Abcam, USA), GRP78 and MMP13 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and β-actin (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology Jiangsu, China). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was used to measure cell proliferation. Cells were inoculated in 96-well plates, pre-incubated for 24 h and then for 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h or 96 h (5% CO2, 37 °C). At each time point, 10 μL CCK-8 solution was added to each well and the cells were further incubated for one to three hours. The absorbance (OD value) was measured using a microplate reader at 450 nm. Transwell chambers were used for conducting migration assays in vitro as described previously [12]. The cells at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well were seeded in the upper chamber (8 μm pore size, Corning, USA). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed with PBS thrice, fixed with methanol for 1 h and then stained with 1% crystal violet for 30 min. The cells on the upper surface of the filter were scraped off, and the cells on the lower surface of the filters were counted under a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus) at 200× magnification in ten randomly selected fields. The experiment was repeated independently three times. RNA‐sequencing data of GRP78 and si-GRP78 in ARO and FRO cells were tested by BGI (Shenzhen, China) [36]. The functional roles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined by the transcriptional profiles that are acquired using RNA-seq and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The GO database was used to analyze the functional enrichment of DEGs, and focused on the pathways enriched in the biological process, molecular function and cellular component that showed association with these genes. The KEGG pathway database was used to determine the enrichment of DEGs. Differential expression of MMP13 and CLO1A1 genes between 512 TC tissues and 337 normal tissues was acquired from the GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/
) [35]. In addition, the differential expression of MMP13 and CLO1A1 genes in terms of pathological stage (I–IV) was analyzed among the TC patients. Statistical significance was calculated with GraphPad Prism Software using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test and Student’s t-test. Data are presented as means ± SD. The values with p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
Placental samples utilized in this study were collected from a larger study and detailed experimental design information is available [6]. Mature Suffolk ewes (n = 57; 4.8 yr of age; 82 kg avg. BW), naïve to endophyte-infected tall fescue, were purchased from a private farm and transported to Clemson University Small Ruminant Facility 90 d prior to the start of the experiment. Ewes were synchronized using an intravaginal controlled internal drug release (CIDR) insert (Eazi-Breed CIDR, Zoetis Animal Health) for 7 d. Upon CIDR removal, ewes were given prostaglandin F2α (12.5 mg i.m.; Lutalyse; Pfizer, New York, NY) and turned in with a purebred Suffolk ram. The ram was fitted with a marking harness and crayon that was changed weekly. Ewes were checked twice daily for marks to estimate breeding date and confirmed pregnant by transrectal ultrasonography on d 30 of gestation. Pregnant Suffolk ewes (n = 32; n = 8/treatment) were randomly assigned to E+ (endophyte-infected; 1.77 mg/head/day of ergovaline and ergovalinine) or E- (endophyte-free; 0 mg/head/day of ergovaline and ergovalinine) tall fescue seed during MID (d 35–85) and/or LATE (d 86–133) gestation which provided four dietary treatments: E−/E-, E+/E-, E−/E+, and E+/E+. Ewes were individually penned into stalls (1.8 × 0.5 × 0.91 m) after 0700 and individually fed their respective treatment diet for 90 min. After individual feeding, ewes were removed from stalls and kept in a large pen (10–12 hd/pen) with ad libitum access to water and minerals (Purina Sheep Mineral, Land O’Lakes Inc., Arden Hills, MN), and with access to inside and outside areas devoid of forage or hay. For this study, a subsample (n = 4/treatment) was selected from the E−/E- and E+/E+ treatments that had twin fetuses and were representative of treatment means for further examination of cotyledon by RNA-seq. Ewe was the experimental unit for this study. On d 133 of gestation, ewes were transported to Godley-Snell Research Facility (14.3 km) at 0730 for terminal surgery. Each ewe was given an intravenous injection of Ketamine (10 mg/kg) and Diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) upon arrival for sedation and intubation. Ewes were intubated with a 10 mm endotracheal tube and placed on 4–5% isoflurane with 1–2 L/min of O2 for induction. Upon successful anesthetization, ewes were maintained at 3–5% isoflurane with 1–2 L/min of O2 and placed on a ventilator at 15–20 breaths per minute. Corneal reflex and heart rate were monitored to confirm adequate levels of anesthesia. The abdominal area was shaved, scrubbed with chlorhexidine, and ewes were subjected to a mid-ventral laparotomy. Once the uterus was exposed, an incision was made in the uterine wall to collect fetuses and a placentome of the type B morphology [78] was selected adjacent to the initial incision. Placentomes were immediately separated into the cotyledon and caruncle portions, and the cotyledon was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C for subsequent RNA extraction. Once removed, fetal lambs were euthanized with a 3 mL intracardiac injection of Beuthanasia-D Special (Merck Animal Health, Madison, New Jersey). Each fetus was towel dried and fetal weight was collected. Once all fetuses were removed, ewes were euthanized with an intravenous injection of 20 mL Beuthanasia-D Special. Placental and fetal data were analyzed using ANOVA with fescue treatment in the model. Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and purified using the PureLink Mini RNA kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer instructions. RNA quantity was estimated using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher). RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). All samples submitted for RNAseq had a RIN value of 9.3 or greater. RNA samples were shipped on dry ice to LCSciences (Houston, TX) for mRNA sequencing. Library preparation was completed using the Illumina Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA USA). Samples were sequenced to an average sequencing depth of 10 M reads using an Illuminia HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform at 50 bp single end reads. Downsampling to ensure uniform coverage between samples was done using seqtk v1.3-r106 (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). FastQC v0.11.7 was used to check quality of the samples [79]. Any low-quality bases and adapter sequences were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.38 [80]. After trimming, 84.8% of the total trimmed reads across all samples were aligned to the ovine reference genome (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-96/fasta/ovis_aries/) using GSNAP v2018-07-04 [81]. Subread’s feature Counts v1.6.2 software was utilized to count uniquely mapped reads that aligned to known genes in the reference genome [82]. Raw gene counts were input to edgeR v3.22.5 and genes with at least 4 samples having at least 1 count per million (cpm) were kept and these counts were normalized [83]. A principal coordinates analysis plot was constructed showing one sample from each treatment to be an outlier. Sequencing and mapping data can be seen in Table 1. These samples were removed leaving n = 3/treatment as seen in Fig. 1. Raw counts from the subset samples were rerun through edgeR, filtering out genes with less than 3 samples having a cpm of less than 1, and used to calculate differentially expressed genes (DEG) in E−/E- vs E+/E+. A volcano plot was generated from the data. Genes were considered differentially expressed if their false discovery rate (FDR) was < 0.05 and their |log2FC| was greater than or equal to 1. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using Panther 14.1 (http://pantherdb.org/). DEGs with a |log2FC| greater than or equal to 1 were used to analyze upregulated and downregulated gene sets separately. Bos taurus was utilized as a reference in the absence of the sheep genome. Panther GO-Slim was used to assess biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. Enriched GO terms were semantically clustered and visualized using REViGO. Upregulated and downregulated genes were analyzed separately. David (v 6.8) was used to determine KEGG pathway enrichment. Gene expression analysis was conducted using quantitative real-time RT-PCR methods according to Duckett and co-workers [84] to serve as a comparison for RNAseq results. Aliquots from the same RNA samples submitted for RNAseq were converted to cDNA using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Bio, Beverly, MA) according to manufacturer instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using a QuantStudio3 (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher) and Perfecta (Quanta Bio, Beverly, MA) SYBR green according to the manufacturer’s directions. An initial hold of 2 min at 95 °C was followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Primers for leukocyte cell derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1), angiotensinogen (AGT), cytochrome p450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6) were designed using PrimerQuest (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT, Coralville, IA) and used to compare to RNA-Seq. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), βactin (bACT), and cyclophilin (CYC) were tested for stability using RefFinder for the selection of the most stable housekeeping gene [85]. The most stable housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was used for normalization. Normalized CT values (ΔCT = CT, gene − CT, GAPDH) were calculated for each sample. The relative quantification was the ratio of the target gene to internal control genes using the ΔΔCT method. Normalized CT values were analyzed using an ANOVA with fescue treatment in the model. Genes in cotyledon tissue from ewes fed E+/E+ fescue were considered differentially expressed relative to control at a cut of P < 0.05 for qPCR.
All the reported QTLs related to the salinity tolerance in rice (from 2009 to 2018) were collected including those identified in 15 previously published studies [9–14, 16, 61–68]. The QTLs data including the parental lines, the type and size of QTL mapping population, and the number of QTLs per trait were provided. Moreover, the flanking molecular markers, Confidence Interval (CI), QTL position, Logarithm of the Odds (LOD) score, and Proportion of Phenotypic Pariance Explained (PVE or R2) were evaluated with respect to each QTL. The QTLs used in this study were derived from various population types (including: F2, backcrossed lines (BC3F4), Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs)), and sizes (from 87 to 285 plants) from different tissues at seedling and reproductive developmental stages (Table S1). The consensus QTL regions were identified using the BioMercator software [69]. The map of the International Rice Microsatellite Initiative (IRMI) available at https://archive.gramene.org (IRMI_2003) was used as the reference map for Meta-QTL analysis. The 95% CI of the initial QTL was computed using the following formulas before projecting the QTLs on the consensus map:
 For F2 lines:  For Double Haploid (DH) lines:  For RILs:  Where, N is the population size and R is the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by the related QTL. The scaling rule between the marker intervals of the initial QTLs was used for the QTL positions on the consensus chromosome map. Meta analysis was performed by the default parameter sets in the BioMercator V4.2 tool. The consensus QTL was calculated as 1, 2, 3, and n models by the software. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to select the QTL models on each chromosome [70]. According to the AIC value, the QTL model with the lowest AIC value was considered as a significant model. RNA-Seq data was obtained from our previous study on two contrasting genotypes of Oryza sativa under salinity stress [31]. Briefly, the young seedlings of FL478 (Salt tolerant) and IR29 (Salt sensitive) were treated with 150 mM NaCl and the root samples were collected 24 h after inception of the salt stress. Along with, normal samples (at the same conditions but without salinity treatment) were also collected as control samples [31]. The purified RNA was used to construct the cDNA library; the qualified libraries were subsequently sequenced using IlluminaHiSeq™ 2500 sequencer. The transcriptome raw data including control (SRR7944745 and SRR7944784) and salt treated samples (SRR7944792 and SRR7944793) of FL478, and control samples (SRR7945188 and SRR7945229) and salt treated samples (SRR7945230 and SRR7945234) of IR29 are available at SRA (Sequence Read Achieve) of NCBI database. The quality of datasets was conducted using the FastQC tool [71]. TopHat was used to map eight paired-end sequencing libraries of two rice genotypes against the rice reference genome sequences IRGSP 1.0 (ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub /plants) [71]. Raw sequencing reads were then assembled through Cufflinks and Cuffmerge meta assembler utilities [71]. Finally, DEGs were identified by Cuffdiff utility, with log2 fold change ≥ 1 (up-regulated genes) and ≤ (− 1) (down-regulated genes) and Q-value cut-off of ≤0.05. The available (by the time of this analysis) transcriptome datasets of rice plants exposed to salinity stress were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) database (Table S7). The genes with − 1 ≥ log2 fold change ≥ 1 and significant Q-value (FDR ≤ 5%) were considered as DEGs from these RNA-seq datasets and were classified into four tissues (i.e. shoot, root, seedling, and leaves). Rice expression data subjected to salt stress were obtained from the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GEO) [71, 72]. Totally, nine GEO datasets were downloaded from the affymetrix platform Rice Genome Array (Affymetrix or Agilent microarray platforms) (Table S5). Each set of the expression data was preprocessed separately. The LIMMA package in the R program was used to analyze Agilent microarray data [73], while affymetrix platforms were handled in the R program by the Affy package. The raw data of each source was preprocessed by the quantile normalization and Robust Multi-Array Average background correction. Then, the probes with low-intensity and non-informative were removed from the program standard settings; then, the probes were transformed to their related genomic location. The RMA was employed for normalization of values for the subsequent MA. Then, the difference between each treatment and its control was computed using the LIMMA package. After fitting the data into a linear model, simple empirical Bayes model was used to revise the standard errors. For each contrast in every gene, moderated t-statistic and log-odds of differential expression were calculated. The genes with − 1 ≥ log2 fold change ≥ 1 and Q-value cut-off of ≤0.05 were determined as DEGs in each of the four tissues. A novel data processing pipeline was proposed in this research integrating different data types to identify promising candidate genes related to salt tolerance in rice (Fig. 4). On one hand, DEGs were integrated in response to salinity stress in rice from both microarray and RNA-Seq technologies. On the other hand, NCBI (NCBI; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) literature was searched to identify the published reports on the salinity tolerance genes in rice. In this research, 111 papers were reviewed and all the reported salinity tolerance-related genes in rice were collected. All the identified genes were classified into four tissues (including shoot, root, seedling, and leaves) (Table S8). Venn diagram (using the R package) was used to compare the overlaps in the detected genes for each tissue using different approaches (including RNA-seq, microarray, and literature review) and the common genes were detected. Finally, salinity tolerance associated meta-QTLs regions were explored to find the DEGs, which are coincided with the meta-QTL positions. For identification of DEGs in meta-QTLs regions, the flanking markers of the identified MQTLs were used to detect the physical intervals for each meta-QTL. Then, the genes located in meta-QTLs regions were found according to the rice genome assembly IRGSP 1.0. Enrichment analysis of the DEGs were performed using the AgriGO public web tool [74]. The over-represented GO terms were filtered in the three main categories including the “Biological Process”, “Molecular Function” and “Cellular Component” using the Fisher’s exact test (Q-value < 0.05) and were corrected by the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method at p < 0.05. The genes observed at least by two approaches (from the three applied methodologies including RNA-seq, microarray and literature review) were called as common genes in this paper.The common genes were sought in the salinity tolerance associated meta-QTLs regions to find the potential candidate genes. The potential candidate genes located on the hotspot-regions overlying original QTLs for both yield components and ion homeostasis traits were assumed as promising candidate genes (Fig. 4). Seeds of FL478 as the salt tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotype were provided from International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Seeds sterilization and germination, as well as plant growth conditions were performed as previously described [31]. Root and shoot samples of 21-days-old treated seedlings with 150 mM NaCl were collected 24 h after inception of the salt stress, instantly put in liquid nitrogen and kept at − 80 °C until RNA extraction. Total RNA extraction was performed by the RNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen) from 100 mg of shoot and root tissues. Integrity and quality of RNA samples was inspected using a NanoDrop ND-1000® spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis. The cDNA library synthesis was done using iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (BioBasic) consistent with the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 15 genes from the list of possible candidate genes were randomly nominated in each tissue (Table S6) for validation by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Specific primer pairs for each gene (Table S9 for list primer) were designed by Oligo 7.0 (National Bioscience Inc., Plymouth, USA). The qRT-PCR with three independent biological replicates was done by a LightCycler® 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Life Science, Germany) and SYBR Premix without ROX based on manufacturer’s protocol. Actin gene of rice (OS03G0836000) was employed as a suitable inner control gene. Transcript levels of nominated genes from three biological replicates were computed as 2- ΔΔCt [75].
T3M4, HPAF-II, LNCaP and their counterparts engineered for inducible overexpression of SOX2, i-SOX2-T3M4, i-SOX2-HPAF-II, i-SOX2-LNCaP have been described previously [15, 16]. ONS76 cells [17] were obtained from Sutapa Ray (UNMC, Omaha, NE). BE(2)C, DU145, and PC3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were engineered for Dox-inducible SOX2 expression, as described previously [14–16]. All parental cells, as well as i-SOX2-derivatives, were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Palbociclib was obtained from Selleckchem (Houston, TX) and suspended in DMSO. Doxycycline (Dox, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To induce SOX2 overexpression, Dox was added to the culture medium at the concentrations and the times indicated. MTT assays were used to assess relative cell growth in triplicate samples, as described previously [14–16]. To complement the results obtained by MTT assays, SOX2-inducible cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Dox for 4 days after which EdU was added to the culture medium for 2 h. Samples were then prepared using a Click-iT EdU flow cytometry kit (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Flow cytometry analysis was performed by the UNMC Flow Cytometry core facility. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed students t-test with a significance threshold of p = 0.05. Cell lines not obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were verified by genetic analysis, which was performed by the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at this medical center. Cells were also tested for the presence of mycoplasma and found to be negative. Animal studies were approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center IACUC Committee and were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Female NCr-nu/nu mice (4 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). All animal protocols were approved by the UNMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For i-SOX2-T3M4 and i-SOX2-HPAF-II 2.5 × 105 cells were resuspended in sterile PBS prior to subcutaneous transplantation. For i-SOX2-DU145, i-SOX2-PC3, and i-SOX2-ONS76 1.5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 3:1 sterile PBS:Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY) and transplanted subcutaneously. In each case, the cells were injected into the right hind flank. After injection, tumor growth was monitored daily. When palpable tumors formed, tumor-bearing mice were randomly sorted into size-matched control and Dox-treated groups. Dox was administered at a dose of 2 mg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in drinking water containing 5% sucrose as indicated. Control mice were given 5% sucrose drinking water. Tumor volumes were calculated based on digital caliper measurements at the indicated times, as described previously [15]. At the completion of the study, mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation for 5 min followed by cervical dislocation and tumors were excised for immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor growth curves were plotted using Microsoft Excel. Analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors was performed, as previously described [15]. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed students t-test with a significance threshold of p = 0.05. Whole cell protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL). RIPA buffer was supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and western blot analysis was performed, as described previously [18, 19]. The following antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers MA) were used for western blot analyses: SOX2 (#3579,1:1000), cyclin D1 (#2978, 1:1000), cyclin E1 (#4129, 1:1000), cyclin A2 (#4656, 1:1000), cyclin B1 (#4138, 1:1000), CDK4 (#12790, 1:1000), CDK2 (#2546, 1:1000), CDK1 (#9116, 1:1000), p27Kip1 (#3686, 1:1000), HDAC1 (#34586, 1:1000), and β-Tubulin (#2146, 1:1000). HDAC1 and β-Tubulin antibodies were used as loading controls. Rabbit primary antibodies were detected with an anti-rabbit-IgG-AP secondary antibody (A3687, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:5000), as described previously [18, 19]. Mouse primary antibodies were detected with an anti-mouse-IgG-AP secondary antibody (A4312, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:5000). Changes in cell cycle-related proteins were confirmed for each cell line by repeating each western blot analysis at least twice. i-SOX2 cells were seeded at subconfluent densities and cultured in the presence or absence of Dox for 4 days. Cells were then prepared for cell cycle analysis by the Telford method, as described previously [14]. Floating cells were harvested and included in the analysis. Flow cytometry analysis was performed by the UNMC Flow Cytometry core facility. To complement the cell cycle results obtained using the Telford method, cells were transduced with the FastFUCCI lentiviral cell cycle indicator [20]. After subculturing the transduced cells, they were cultured in the presence or absence of the indicated doses of Dox for 4 days, then harvested and analyzed for fluorescent signal by the UNMC Flow Cytometry core facility. At the conclusion of the tumor growth studies, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and processed for IHC. Formalin-fixed tumor sections were paraffin-embedded and stained for H&E, SOX2, cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), and p27Kip1 by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Tissue Sciences Facility. The antibodies used for IHC were: SOX2 (Abcam, ab92494, 1:100), CC3 (Abcam, ab4051, 1:200), and p27Kip1 (Cell Signaling, CST83630, 1:700). To quantify the proportion of epithelial cells with protein-of-interest expression, at least 3 distinct, 40X fields were photographed for each independent tumor sample. The ‘count tool’ within Adobe Photoshop (v. 20.0.5) was used to quantitate epithelial cells with positive staining and total cells within the photographed field. Photographs were obtained and cell positivity was scored by an anatomic pathologist unaware of sample designation. Mitotic index (mitoses per 40X field) was used to quantify tumor proliferative rate, and was determined by averaging mitotic figures seen in at least 6, 40X fields for each tumor, using H&E stained slides. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Cells were lysed in provided RLT buffer and spun through Qiashredder columns (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer’s protocols. RNA was eluted from the column in RNase-free water. cDNA synthesis was performed using the High Fidelity 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). Synthesis was performed for 1 h at 42 °C after which the reaction was terminated for 15 min at 70 °C. Primers used in RT-PCR to measure mRNA levels are provided in Table 1. qPCR amplification and quantification was performed on a Bio Rad CFX96 Real time PCR detection system (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA) and detected using RT2 SYBR Green qPCR mastermix (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Transcripts for each gene (control and Dox-treated) were measured in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed students t-test with a significance threshold of p = .05.
 Primers used for qPCR
C. annuum cultivars CM334 and Dempsey were provided by the Vegetable Breeding Research Center (VBRC) in Republic of Korea. CM334 and Dempsey were germinated and grown in soil under 16 h light and 8 h dark photoperiod at 25 ± 1 °C in a growth chamber. Pepper CM334 calluses were produced in a callus inducing media (CIM, MS media contained with B5 vitamins, 3% of sucrose, 1 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) from fully expanded young leaves and were maintained in CIM by regular subculturing every 3 weeks [32]. The pepper calluses from the two cultivars were digested in a cell wall digesting enzyme solution [47] for 3–4 h at 24 ± 1 °C to isolate the protoplasts. The digested pepper protoplasts were diluted with an equal volume of W5 solution (154 mM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, 1.5 mM Mes-KOH, pH 5.6) to remove the cell wall digesting enzyme solution. The pepper protoplasts were gently collected by centrifugation at 58 g for 5 min, and then rinsed with W5 solution two times. The purely isolated pepper protoplasts were counted using a hemocytometer. Approximately 5 × 104 isolated protoplasts were used for PEG-mediated CRISPR-RNPs delivery, as described previously [18] with slight modifications. Briefly, Cas9 or LbCpf1 proteins were premixed with an in silico designed guide RNA as a 1:6 M ratio for 1 h at room temperature. The preassembled RNP mixtures were carefully suspended with the counted protoplasts in 300 μl of MMG solution (400 mM mannitol, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MES; pH 5.6). Subsequently, an equal volume of freshly prepared PEG solution (200 mM mannitol, 100 mM CaCl2, 40% PEG 4000) was added. The PEG-mixed pepper protoplasts were washed three times with an equal volume of serial dilutions using the W5 solution. They were then harvested by centrifugation at 58 g for 5 min and subsequently incubated in W5 solution. After incubation for the indicated time (24 or 48 h), CRISPR-RNPs-transfected protoplasts were prepared for genomic DNA extraction and finally analyzed for target gene editing. CaMLO2 genomic regions from the two cultivars were sequenced by Sanger sequencing to confirm the nucleotide sequences and design the guide RNAs. We used Cas-Designer of RGEN tools (http://rgenome.net) to devise specific candidate sgRNAs for Cas9 and crRNAs for LbCpf1. We obtained two sgRNAs (sgRNA1: 5′-ACATCTTCATCTGCCTTACA-3′, sgRNA2: 5′-TGATGACCCTTGTTTACAAA-3′) in the third exon for Cas9 and two crRNAs (crRNA1: 5′-TTGAACAAATTATGCATCACCTT-3′, crRNA2: 5′-GGGACACATAAGTTAGAAACTGG-3′) in the first and third exons for LbCpf1. The guide RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) as described previously [18, 24]. Primers used for in vitro transcription are listed in Table 2.
 Primers used in guide-RNA synthesis Pepper genomic DNA was prepared with a Plant SV Mini kit (GeneAll, Seoul, South Korea) and used as a template to amplify the target DNA regions of CaMLO2. The activity of the designed guide RNAs was validated by an in vitro cleavage assay [18]. Briefly, 240 ng of target DNA amplicons were digested with 2 μg of purified Cas9 or LbCpf1 and 1.5 μg of guide RNA in 2 μL of 10X NEB 3.1 buffer (NEB) for 1.5 h at 37 °C and subsequently incubated with RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C. The digested target DNA was purified using an MG PCR purification SV kit (MGmed, Seoul, South Korea) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The indel frequency and patterns were analyzed by targeted deep sequencing [18]. The prepared pepper genomic DNA was amplified with specific primers (listed in Table 3) for each guide RNA. The target amplicons were attached with multiplexing indices and specific sequencing adaptors by consecutive PCRs and subjected to high-throughput sequencing using Illumina Miseq (V2, 300 cycle) (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea). The raw data of paired-end Miseq were analyzed using a Cas-Analyzer (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-analyzer/#!) from the RGEN tools [48].
 Primers used in targeted deep sequencing Primary F for sgRNA1, sgRNA2, crRNA2 Primary R for sgRNA1, sgRNA2, crRNA2 Secondary F for sgRNA1, sgRNA2, crRNA2 Secondary R for sgRNA1, sgRNA2, crRNA2 The target regions of CaMLO2 edited by complexes of Cas9-sgRNA1, Cas9-sgRNA2, LbCpf1-crRNA1, or LbCpf1-crRNA2 were amplified by three consecutive PCR runs. First, the genomic region of CaMLO2 was amplified with a primer pair of CaMLO2 F and CaMLO2 R. The first PCR amplicons were used for primary PCR with primer pairs of primary F and R. The second PCR amplicons were subsequently applied by adding Illumina adaptor with primer pairs of secondary F and R. The final amplicons were subjected to bar-coding for Next Generation Sequence (NGS) analysis using Illumina Miseq The data are presented as the means of at least three biological replicates with standard deviation. The significant difference (*, P < 0.01) was assessed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD.
Five different experiments were conducted for data collection (Table 4). Experimental samples were all collected from one-year old T. ciliata, grown in a greenhouse in South China Agricultural University (SCAU). For samples from different tissues, mature leaves, young leaves, flowers, shoots, and young stems were collected at 9:00 am on August 25, 2019. Before treatment with the H. robusta, PEG6000, 4 °C, and MeJA, all the seedlings were pre-incubated in incubator for 7 days with 16 h of light at 28 °C and 8 h of dark at 22 °C to mimic the wild environment. For H. robusta treatment, seedlings were exposed to herbivores, and leaves and young stems were harvested after 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h. After seedlings were treated with 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30% (w/v) of PEG6000 for 7 days, leaves were collected. For 4 °C treatment, seedlings were placed at 4 °C, and samples (leaves) were taken at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h. Seedlings sprayed with MeJA (100 μM) were sealed in plastic bags and leaves were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h. Three biological replicates were taken for each sampling point, and all samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C.
 Experimental details Total RNA was extracted from all samples using a HiPure HP Plant RNA Mini Kit (Magen) with DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA. The quality of the RNA was determined with NanoDrop ND1000 (Thermo Scientific). RNA samples with absorbance ratios of A260/A280 and A260/A230 both around 2.0 were selected for further analysis. To synthesize cDNA, 0.5 μg of total RNA was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the HiScript II Reverse Transcript kit (Vazyme). Five-fold diluted cDNA was used for subsequent RT-qPCR experiments. Twenty candidate reference genes were selected from the T. ciliata leaf transcriptome database by reviewing previous literature: PGK, 60S-18, 60S-13, HIS1, HIS6, PP2C57, PP2C59, UBC5B, UBC17, ACT7, SAMDC, EF1, EF2, 18S, TUB-α, TUB-β, MUB1, PPIA26, PPIA95, TIP41. Since there is no genomic sequence data available for T. ciliata, we designed primers based on the sequences in the T. ciliata transcriptome database. Firstly, the Coding Sequence (CDS) and genomic DNA sequences (gDNA) of the candidate reference genes were amplified separately (Table S1), and then the introns and exons of the candidate reference genes were obtained by sequence alignment (NCBI-Blast), and finally primers for RT-qPCR analysis of each reference gene were designed using the web-based Primer-Blast tool from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). Apart from 60S-18, SAMDC, TUB-β and PPIA26, RT-qPCR primers were designed across introns. Details of these genes and primers are shown in Table 1. The volume of each PCR amplification reaction mix was 20 μL, containing 10 μL of Phata Max Buffer, 2 μL of five-fold diluted cDNA, 2 μL of each primer (10 μM), 0.5 μL of dNTP, 0.5 μL of Phata Max Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, and 5 μL ddH2O. The PCR reaction procedure was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s, followed by 5 min extension at 72 °C. The RT-qPCR reaction mixture consisted of 10 μL ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme), 2 μL of cDNA, 0.4 μL of each primer (10 μM), and 7.2 μL ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μL, and it was performed on LightCycler480 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) with optical 96-well plate. To test the specificity of the RT-qPCR primers, the products of PCR were analyzed by nucleic acid electrophoresis on a 2% (w/v) gel and the melting curve was included after amplification. All samples used for RT-qPCR analysis had three biological replicates, each containing three technical replicates. In order to calculate the gene-specific PCR efficiency (E) and correlation coefficient (R2) of each gene, a standard curve was generated from the mixed complementary DNA (cDNA) using a fivefold dilution series. CT values were obtained by RT-qPCR, and used to evaluate the expression levels of candidate genes in different experimental conditions and tissues. Three commonly employed algorithms, geNorm [24], NormFinder [25], and BestKeeper [26], were used to evaluate the stability of candidate reference genes in different experiments. The package geNorm (Version3.5) screens stable reference genes by calculating the M value of the stability of each candidate gene, and the criterion is that the smaller the M value is, the higher the stability of the candidate gene is. It also calculates pairwise variations of the normalized factor after introducing a new internal reference gene, and determines the number of optimal internal reference genes based on the ratio Vn / Vn + 1. If the value of Vn / Vn + 1 is less than 0.15, the number of optimal internal reference genes is n. If the value of Vn / Vn + 1 is greater than 0.15, the number of optimal reference genes is n + 1. NormFinder selects the most suitable internal reference gene by calculating a stability value for gene expression of the candidates. The lower the stability value is, the more stable the gene is. Using BestKeeper, the SD and CV of expression of each candidate gene can be obtained. The CV ± SD values of different genes were then compared to determine the relative stability of expression of the candidates. Finally, in order to generate an overall ranking of candidate genes from the data generated by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, we used the RankAggreg (version 0.6.5) software package in R as previously described [14, 55–57]. RankAggreg is an algorithmic package that can combine different ranking lists. Based on the size of the rankings list, we used the Cross-Entropy Monte Carlo algorithm [34]. The rankings list previously generated by the three packages were used as input with the following parameters: the distance was calculated using Spearman’s Footrule function, with rho set at 0.1, the seed at 100, and the “convIn” argument at 50. In order to verify the accuracy of the rankings and the stability of expression of the selected reference genes, the two most stable reference genes, alone and in combination, and the two most unstable reference genes, as recommended by RankAggreg were used to verify the relative expression of TcMYB3 under 4 °C, MeJA, PEG6000, in different tissues, and under H. robusta treatment (leaves and young stems). Finally, we used the 2-△△CT method to calculate the relative expression levels of the verified genes, where △CT = CT (target gene)-CT (reference gene), △△CT = △CT (treatment)-△ CT (control), 2-△△CT = relative expression. Three technical replicates were performed for each biological sample [58].
We ran MUSTACHE on (i) Hi-C contact maps for human cell lines GM12878 and K562 obtained from Rao et al. [9], (ii) Hi-C and Micro-C contact maps of HFFc6 cell line obtained from Krietenstein et al. [12], and (iii) Micro-C contact maps of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) from Hsieh et al. [25] (Additional file 1: Table S1). For assessing the consistency of loop calls at different resolutions and for measuring reproducibility across replicates, we also used 10 kb GM12878 Hi-C contact maps. All contact maps were produced using a minimum read alignment quality MAPQ ≥ 30. GM12878, K562, and HFFc6 Hi-C data consisted of approximately 4.9B, 1B, and 3B valid read pairs, respectively. HFFc6 and mESC Micro-C data had 4.4B and 2.6B valid read pairs, respectively. For all experiments at 5 kb or 10 kb resolution, we considered contacts within the genomic distance range of 20 kb to 2 Mb. For 1 kb resolution Micro-C analysis, we used 5 kb to 2 Mb distance range. For all cases, we employed MUSTACHE with default parameters: σ0=1.6,s=10 and oc=2,st=0.88, where σ0 is the initial scale, s denotes the number of scales/levels, oc denotes the number of octaves, and st refers to the sparsity threshold as described in the “Methods” section. We selected these datasets because they are the most extensively studied, they are generated with very high-depth sequencing, and these cell lines have readily available orthogonal datasets including ChIP-seq, ChIA-PET, and HiChIP, which we used for validating our results. For the 5-kb resolution Hi-C map of GM12878 (obtained by combining the two replicates), MUSTACHE resulted in 18,068 loop calls for q value < 0.05. For the 10-kb resolution GM12878 data, we obtained 14,045 loops from the combined contact map, and 11,872 and 10,976 loops from the primary and replicate experiments, respectively, using the same q value threshold of 0.05. For the combined 5-kb K562 Hi-C data from the same publication, we identified 8975 loops at a q value of 0.1. On the 5-kb resolution HFFc6 cell line, MUSTACHE called 16,132 loops from the Hi-C data and 36,494 loops from Micro-C data with the q value <0.01 (24,045 loops for q value <0.001). For the 1-kb resolution Micro-C data at q value threshold of 0.01, MUSTACHE reported 50,472 loops for HFFc6 and 11,231 loops for mESC data.
Mice were kept at the animal facility of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). All experiments were carried out according to Dutch law and Leiden University guidelines and were approved by the National and Local Animal Experiments Committees. The D4Z4-2.5, Dnmt3bMommeD14 and Smchd1MommeD1 mouse models were generated before [17, 24, 25]. D4Z4-2.5/Dnmt3bMommeD14 mice were obtained by cross-breeding hemizygous female D4Z4-2.5 mice on a C57BL6/J background with heterozygous male Dnmt3bMommeD14 mice on a FVB/NJ background. D4Z4–2.5/Smchd1MommeD1 mice were obtained by cross-breeding female hemizygous D4Z4-2.5 mice with male heterozygous Smchd1MommeD1 mice, both on a C57BL6/J background. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages with a standard 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. Standard rodent chow and water were available ad libitum. The sex of the mice was recorded at 15 days by visual inspection and confirmed during dissection or during weaning. Offspring was genotyped by PCR analysis on ear DNA. To detect the D4Z4-2.5 transgene, the following primers were used: 5′-TGGTCCGTGAAGACATGTGT-3′ and 5′-GAGCCCTCAGAGAAGTGGG-3′. For the Dnmt3bMommeD14 mutation, the following primers were used: 5′-ATGAGGAGAGCCGAGGTGAT-3′ and 5′-ACAGCTGACACTGCCCTCTT-3′. For the Dnmt3bMommeD14 mutation, PCR products were digested with a RsaI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs; Bioké, Leiden, the Netherlands). To detect the Smchd1MommeD1 mutation, the following primers were used: 5′-CAATAGGTCCCCCTCATCAA-3′ and 5′-CAGTGGCCAACCACATAACA-3′. An internal probe with the sequence 5′-CAACATAACAGCACAACCAAAGCTG-3′ was added to the PCR mix and afterwards PCR products were melted using the Lightscanner (Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, USA). mESCs from D4Z4-2.5 mice were generated from E3.5 blastocysts after natural mating. mESCs (D4Z4-2.5 B4 and B6 cell lines) were maintained on a 0.1% gelatin coating and mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in mESC medium (Knockout DMEM Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biowest, VWR international B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), 1% non-essential amino acids solution (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), and 1000 U/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Merck, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). For siRNA transfections, mESCs were cultured in a 12 well culture dish on 0.1% gelatin without MEFs. Pre-designed siRNA SMARTpool for Dnmt3b (M-044164-01-0005, Dharmacon; Horizon Discovery Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and luciferase siRNA 1 (D-002050-01-20, Dharmacon; Horizon Discovery Ltd., Cambridge, UK) at a concentration of 40 nM and 2 μl RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) were used. Transfection medium was changed to mESC medium the next day and cells were harvested after 48 h. The EDL muscle was removed from mice and incubated at 37 °C for 105 min in 0.2% collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) in DMEM medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) (Sigma Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands). Muscle fibers were further dissociated with a glass Pasteur pipette with a smooth end and were transferred to a 6 well culture dish coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Vianen, the Netherlands) in DMEM medium supplemented with 30% FBS, 10% horse serum, 1% P/S, 1% chicken embryo extract, and 2.5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands). Fibers were removed and attached myoblasts were trypsinized and plated in new Matrigel-coated plates. Myoblasts were harvested for RNA or differentiated by changing medium to DMEM with 2% horse serum and 1% P/S. Differentiated myotubes were harvested 72 h after the start of differentiation. Total RNA was isolated with the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A DNase treatment on the column for 30 min at RT was included. RNA concentrations were measured with the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands). 1–3 μg RNA was reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit with Oligo(dT) primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands). The cDNA was treated with RNaseH (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) for 20 min at 37 °C. The Dnmt3bMommeD14 variant was confirmed in D4Z4-2.5/Dnmt3bMommeD14 mice with a PCR spanning exons 12 and 14 with the following primers: 5′-CGAAGACGCACAACCAATGA-3′ and 5′-TTTCCACAGGACAAACAGCG-3′. For RT-qPCR with the CFX96 system (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, the Netherlands), iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad), 0.5 pM forward and reverse primer (Table 1) and 1:5 or 1:50 diluted cDNA were used with the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and a melting temperature of 60 °C for 30 s, followed by a melting curve analysis from 65 °C to 95 °C (temperature increments of 0.5 °C). Data was analyzed with Bio-Rad CFX Manager version 3.1 (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, the Netherlands). Obtained values were normalized to the housekeeping genes Gapdh and Rpl13a.
 List of RT-qPCR primers Genomic DNA from the tail and spleen was bisulfite converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning kit (Zymo Research; BaseClear Lab Products, Leiden, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A PCR reaction of the pLAM region just distal to the D4Z4 repeat array was performed [28]. PCR products were next ligated into a TOPO TA vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) and the resulting ligation products were transformed into competent D5Hα bacteria by heat shock. Plasmid DNA from at least 10 colonies of transformed D5Hα bacteria was isolated and sent for Sanger sequencing. mESCs were maintained on a 0.1% gelatin coating and mitotically inactivated MEFs in mESC medium. Spleen tissue was minced into small pieces. Both mESCs and splenic tissue were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde. 125 mM glycine was added after 10 min to stop the crosslinking. Cells and tissues were lysed with cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal for spleen tissues and 0.5% Igepal for mESCs). The nuclei were lysed with nuclear lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8.1). Chromatin of mESCs was sheared with 15 cycles of 30 s and spleen tissue using 10 cycles of 30 s with the Bioruptor (Pico; Diagenode, Ougrée, Belgium). The fragmentation was verified on a 1% agarose gel after phenol-chloroform extraction. For the Dnmt3b ChIP, 50 μg chromatin was used as input and for each histone ChIP 3 μg chromatin was used. Per antibody, chromatin was pre-cleared with 20 μl protein A Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Pre-cleared chromatin was incubated overnight with 5 μg of one of the following antibodies: Dnmt3b (ab2851; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), IgG (PP64; Merck, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), H3K9me3 (39161; Active Motif, Carlsbad, USA), or H3K4me2 (39141; Active Motif, Carlsbad, USA). The immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 20 μl protein A Sepharose beads with the antibody-chromatin mix for 2 h at 4 °C. Washing of the beads was performed according to a previously published protocol [29]. DNA was isolated from the beads with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, the Netherlands). qPCR to amplify the D4Z4 repeat was performed with the following primers: 5′-CCGCGTCCGTCCGTGAAA-3′ and 5′-TCCGTCGCCGTCCTCGTC-3′ [9]. Testis and mESCs were homogenized in lysis buffer (8 M Urea, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4). The lysates were sonicated for 10 cycles of 30 s with the Bioruptor (Pico; Diagenode, Ougrée, Belgium). After centrifugation, the supernatant was kept and protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) and transferred to a Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (Merck, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The membrane was incubated in 4% skim milk/PBS overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: rabbit-anti-Dnmt3b antibody (ab2851; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; 1:600 dilution) and mouse-anti-emerin (NCL-emerin, clone 4G5; Novocastra; Leica Biosystems B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 1:375 dilution). The following day, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibodies donkey-anti-rabbit-IRdye 800cw (1:5000 dilution) and donkey-anti-mouse-IRdye 680RD (1:5000 dilution) (Li-Cor, Bad Homburg, Germany) for 1 h at RT in 4% skim milk/PBS. The membrane was scanned with the Odyssey CLx imager (Li-Cor, Bad Homburg, Germany). The spleen was dissected from euthanized mice. Immune cells were separated from stromal tissues by mincing the organs and straining the tissue through a 70 μm cell strainer. Single cells were stained with cell surface antibodies (Table 2) for 20 min at 4 °C in FACS buffer (DPBS with 1% FBS and 0.05% sodium azide). Cells were fixed for 45 min at RT with True-Nuclear Fix solution (Biolegend, London, UK). For intracellular staining with FoxP3 (Table 2) for 30 min at RT, the True-Nuclear Permeabilization Buffer (Biolegend, London, UK) was used. Cells were measured with the Canto I (Becton Dickinson B.V., Vianen, the Netherlands) and analyzed with FlowJo software v10.6.1 (Becton Dickinson B.V., Vianen, the Netherlands).
 List of surface and intracellular (FoxP3) anti-mouse antibodies that were used for flow cytometry Skeletal muscles were dissected from euthanized mice, embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Tissue-Tek) and frozen in cooled isopentane. Cryosections of 7 μm were made and stained with hematoxylin, followed by eosin staining. Cryosections were dehydrated using increasing ethanol concentrations and xylene. Stained skeletal muscle sections were analyzed by light microscopy (Leica Microsystems B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Statistical tests were performed with GraphPad Prism software (version 8; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, USA). For all figures, the statistical tests that were performed are described in the figure legends. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.
We created a fusion construct containing an N-terminal histidine tag, human full length p53, an 8-amino acid linker (GSSGGSSG), and a C-terminal SNAP tag. The p53-SNAP used in the experiment shown in Fig. 1A had the amino acid sequence KL prior to the linker. We used PCR with plasmids containing p53 or SNAP sequences and inserted isolated DNA fragments into the pACEBac1 baculovirus transfer vector via EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. The p53-SNAP pACEBac1 plasmid was transformed into DH10EmBacY cells (Geneva Biotech) and cells were plated on agar plates for blue-white screening (50 µg/mL kanamycin, 10 µg/mL tetracycline, 7 µg/mL gentamycin, 100 µg/mL X-Gal, 40 µg/mL IPTG). A white colony, reflecting the correct transposition of the p53-SNAP insert into the bacmid DNA present within DH10EmBacY cells, was used to inoculate an overnight culture. Bacmid DNA, prone to fragmentation, was prepared from the culture using the following protocol. The cells were pelleted, then resuspended in 330 µL of solution I (15 mM Tris pH 7.9, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 100 µg/mL RNase A, filter sterilized), followed by addition of 330 µL of solution II (0.2 M NaOH, 1% SDS, filter sterilized). The sample was inverted once to mix and incubated 5 min at room temperature, then 460 µL of 3 M potassium acetate (pH 5.5, autoclaved) was added, gently mixed by inverting, and incubated 5 min on ice. The sample was then centrifuged, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the sample was subjected to a second centrifugation. The supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 900 µL of isopropanol and gently mixed by inverting. After a 15 min incubation on ice, the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol then air dried for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was solubilized in TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, filter sterilized), avoiding mechanical resuspension. The DNA was filtered using a 0.22 µm Spin-X column (Fisher Scientific). Bacmid DNA was sent to the Protein Production/MoAB/Tissue Culture Shared Resource facility at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to produce the baculovirus viral stock for infection of SF-9 insect cells to express p53-SNAP. Insect cell pellets were screened for protein expression using western blots against p53, the SNAP tag, and the His tag. An SF-9 insect cell pellet expressing full length p53-SNAP was thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer B (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 µg/mL Pepstatin A, 1 × EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (Roche), 1 × PhosSTOP (Roche)) by vortexing then incubating on ice for 15 min before centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a HisPur Ni–NTA resin (Thermo Scientific) column that was pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer B. The column was then washed sequentially with lysis buffer B, wash buffer A [50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 µg/mL Pepstatin A, 1 × EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 × PhosSTOP (Roche)], and wash buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole. p53-SNAP was eluted with wash buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole. Fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing the most p53-SNAP were pooled and dialyzed overnight in 50 mM Tris pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. The purified protein was evaluated by western blots with antibodies against p53, the SNAP tag, and the His tag to confirm the identities of bands on SDS gels. For the protein labeling reaction, 100 µL of p53-SNAP (diluted to a concentration less than 10 µM) was incubated with 2 µL of 1 mM SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor647 dye (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Excess free dye was removed using Zeba Spin Desalting columns (7 K MWCO, 0.5 mL, Thermo Scientific). A coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel with a BSA standard curve was used to calculate the total concentration of p53-SNAP. The concentration of AF647-p53 was evaluated by comparison to a standard curve of AF647-SNAP substrate and a standard curve of an AF647-labeled oligonucleotide using a Typhoon 9500 Imager. The absorbance at 652 nm and the molar absorptivity of AF647 was also used to calculate the concentration of AF647 in the labeled p53. In addition, LC–MS/MS was used to measure the amount of the 16-amino acid peptide (TALSGNPVPILIPCHR) containing the site of AF647 dye attachment in trypsin digested samples of unlabeled p53-SNAP and AF647-p53. The peptide was not detectable in the AF647-p53 sample, but readily detectable in the p53-SNAP sample, indicating complete conjugation to the dye. The sequences of the DNA constructs used in binding assays were as follows (ordered HPLC purified from Integrated DNA Technologies): wild type reverse oligo, 5′CGACGCCAGCATGCTTAGACATGTTCGCTCTA3′ and wild type forward oligo, 5′TAGAGCGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGCGTCG3′; mutant half site reverse oligo, 5′GACGCCGCCTTTGAAAGACATGTTCGCTCTA3′ and mutant half site forward oligo, 5′TAGAGCGAACATGTCTTTCAAAGGCGGCGTCG3′; deleted half site reverse oligo, 5′CGACGCAGACATGTTCGCTCTA3′ and deleted half site forward oligo, 5′TAGAGCGAACATGTCTGCGTCG3′; random DNA reverse oligo, 5′TATTCGTGTCAGCCCCTACCCGATTAGGAACG3′ and random DNA forward oligo, 5′CGTTCCTAATCGGGTAGGGGCTGACACGAATA3′; 5 bp insert reverse oligo, 5′CGACGCCAGCATGCTTTCCACAGACATGTTCGCTCTA3′ and 5 bp insert forward oligo, 5′TAGAGCGAACATGTCTGTGGAAAGCATGCTGGCGTCG3′; 10 bp insert reverse oligo 5′CGACGCCAGCATGCTTATTAATTCATAGACATGTTCGCTCTA3′ and 10 bp insert forward oligo 5′TAGAGCGAACATGTCTATGAATTAATAAGCATGCTGGCGTCG3′. For single molecule experiments, all reverse oligos contained a AF647 dye on the 5′ end and all forward oligos contained a 5′ biotin attached to a 24 nt single stranded linker: 5′CGCGTTCATGGTAGAGTCGTGGAC3′. For EMSAs, all reverse oligos were radiolabeled on the 5′end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and γ32P-ATP. Double stranded DNAs were generated by annealing the forward and reverse oligos by heating to 95 °C for 10 min and slowly cooling to room temperature in the temp block on the bench top. For single molecule experiments, annealed DNAs were gel purified on a native 7% polyacrylamide gel (containing 0.5 × TBE, pre-run at 150 V for 30 min prior to loading DNA samples). DNAs were cut out of the gel, slices were crushed in TE-Low buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA), then nutated overnight nutation at 4 °C. DNA was isolated using Spin-X columns (Fisher Scientific) and ethanol precipitation. DNA binding reactions (20 µL) were assembled with wild type p53, p53-SNAP, or AF647-p53 (concentrations noted in figure legends) and 32P-DNA (0.1 nM for Fig. 1B and 0.03 nM for Figs. 1D and 3B) in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT and 0.05 mg/mL BSA. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were run on 4% native polyacrylamide gels (containing 0.5 × TBE, pre-run at 150 V for 30 min) in 0.5 × TBE running buffer at 150 V for 1 h. Gels were then dried and imaged on a Typhoon 9500 Imager. Images of gels were viewed using ImageJ 1.42q software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/); brightness/contrast adjustments were applied equally to the entire image. Un-cropped images of the EMSAs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. Cleaning and assembly of the flow chambers and preparation of stock solutions of streptavidin, d-glucose, glucose oxidase, catalase, and 100 mM Trolox (Sigma) for single molecule microscopy were as previously described. All single molecule binding assays were performed at room temperature. Flow chambers were washed twice with MilliQ water and 1 × buffer (25 mM Tris 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% NP-40) prior to use. The surface was then incubated with 0.2 mg/mL streptavidin (Sigma) and 0.8 mg/mL BSA diluted in 1 × buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Excess streptavidin was washed out with additional 1 × buffer. 10 pM of biotinylated DNA was then flowed onto the surface and incubated for 10 min to allow immobilization. Excess DNA was washed out with additional 1 × buffer. Imaging buffer (1.02 mg/mL glucose oxidase, 0.04 mg/mL catalase, and 0.83% d-glucose diluted in 1 × buffer containing 3.45 mM Trolox) was then flowed into the chamber. DNA emission movies were collected over four regions with the use of a piezo nano-positioning stage. AF647-p53 (1 nM monomer) in imaging buffer was flowed into the chamber and incubated for 10 min. Without washing, p53 + DNA emission movies were collected over the same regions as the DNA emission movies using the piezo stage. Emission movies were collected with a 1.49 NA immersion objective based TIRF microscope (Nikon TW-2000U) equipped with two CCD cameras and a nano-positioning stage. Emission from the 635 nm laser with a power setting of 108 mW was recorded by a Cascade II Photometric CCD camera using the NIS-elements software. Emission movies of DNA only were collected with a 60 ms frame rate for 100 frames over 4 separate regions (512 × 512-pixels, 200 nm per pixel) per slide. Using the nano-positioning stage, emission movies of p53 + DNA were then collected over the same 4 regions with a 60 ms frame rate for 1000 frames to obtain bound dwell times for the wild type and mutant DNAs. To obtain unbound dwell times on wild type DNA the data were collected with a 200 ms frame rate for 2000 frames, and a 600 ms frame rate for 1000 frames; for the mutant half site DNA these parameters were 60 ms for 5000 frames. In-house software written in IDL was used to co-localize spots in the DNA and p53 + DNA movies, quantify the oligomeric state of bound p53, and extract dwell times. Briefly, for co-localization of the fluorescent DNA and AF647-p53 spots, a gaussian of spot density was built for the entire movie. Spots near the edges of the image were not used in analysis; typically a region of ~ 480 × 400 pixels was analyzed, with a total of ~ 750 DNA spots. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows images of slide surfaces with DNA alone, DNA + AF647-p53, and AF647-p53 alone. To computationally identify potential spot pairs a pixel-by-pixel sum was performed for the frames of a DNA movie and separately for the frames of a paired DNA + AF647-p53 movie of the same slide region. The locations of fluorescent spots were identified in each of the summed images by searching an image for a peak of intensity that fell within user input intensity thresholds, which once set, remained consistent for the entire analysis. The locations of spots in the two movies were compared and any spot between the movies within 2 pixels of one another were considered a potential spot pair. After computationally finding potential spot pairs, each pair was manually visualized and evaluated, and those with anomalies were rejected. Spot pairs were rejected if, for example, the Gaussian for an individual spot showed multiple peaks, indicating that two spots were likely too close together to distinguish which was used for colocalization. For a spot pair found between the DNA movie and p53 + DNA emission movie, the intensity trace from the DNA emission movie was used to calculate a base red intensity (N) that corresponded to the value of a single AF647 dye. The value N was used to calculate the number of dyes present for each state in the p53 + DNA intensity trace of the spot pair. The total number of dyes was used to characterize a state as being unbound (one dye, N) or bound by tetrameric p53 (four or five total dyes; 4 N or 5 N). Transitions between different intensity states representing dissociation or association of p53 tetramers were identified. Potential state changes were computationally distinguished from noise by calculating the noise and standard deviation of the noise within the data in each time trace, and comparing frame-by-frame changes in intensity to the noise. An increase or decrease was computationally considered a potential state change if the change in intensity between adjacent frames was greater than two times the noise, greater than three times the standard deviation in the noise, and at least a 20% change. All computationally identified state changes were further considered manually and those with anomalies were rejected. The number of unbound DNA states, dynamic tetrameric p53/DNA bound states, bound dwell times, and unbound dwell times between states were calculated then compiled for all regions for a given experiment. Spots showing bound p53 with no transitions across the time of collection were not included in subsequent analyses. To determine rate constants, dwell times from independent replicate experiments were combined and plotted as cumulative sums. The data were initially fit with a single exponential equation using Prism 8 software (https://www.graphpad.com) to obtain rate constants and 95% confidence intervals of the fit. In the cases of bound dwell times measured with the wild type and 5 bp insert DNAs, the data were not well fit with a single exponential equation, hence a double exponential equation was used. We reported the value of each rate constant (k) with the smallest number of significant digits that showed a meaningful range for the value of k in the 95% confidence interval. The half times for binding and unbinding were calculated from the equation for the half-time of a first-order reaction: t1/2 = ln2/k. The value for tau in Table 1 is 1/k.
Experimental procedures were approved by an external independent animal experiment committee (CCD, Central Animal Experiments Committee, The Netherlands), and after positive advice by the Committee for Animal Experimentation of the University of Groningen. Subsequently, the study design was approved by the local Animal Welfare Body Procedures complied with the principles of good laboratory animal care following the European Directive 2010/63/EU for the use of animals for scientific purposes. All animals were kept in a temperature-controlled room (21 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 10% humidity, lights on 8 AM–8 PM) in type 1L (360 cm2) polysulfone cages bearing stainless-steel wire covers (UNO BV, the Netherlands), with wood shaving bedding, Enviro-dri (TecniLab, The Netherlands) and cardboard rolls. All mice were handled by the same researcher (OR). Virgin C57BL/6JOlaHsd breeders (11M, 22F) 12 weeks of age (Envigo, The Netherlands) were acclimatized for 2 weeks. They were time-mated in 2F + 1M couples. See for the paradigm used. Males were removed after 2 days. Pregnancy was confirmed by a > 2 g increase in body weight after 1 week. Pregnancy occurred in 15 females. Nonpregnant females were mated again for a maximum of 4 times. Delivery day was recorded as postnatal day (PN) 0. Pups were randomized between dams, and litters were culled to 4M + 2F at PN2, weaned at PN21, and diets were provided as daily freshly prepared dough balls (40% water) from PN16 to PN42. Care was taken to minimize handling and stress prior to weaning. No measurements were made prior to weaning. It was reasoned that handling prior to weaning may have disturbed the IMF’s metabolic programming potential and/or the stress of handling may have programmed the pups in itself. It was assumed that any differences measured at PN21 were due to the IMF. This study was not performed blinded as the programming diets were visually distinct. Breeders and female offspring were terminated (CO2) at weaning, in compliance with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Two IMF powders (Nutricia Cuijk B.V., Cuijk, the Netherlands) were used. The IMF powders had a similar macro- and micronutrient content (Table 3), as provided by the supplier. The lipid moieties of the two IMF powders both comprised about 50% vegetable oil and 50% milkfat and had a similar fatty acid profile (Table 2), as assessed internally with methodology shown below. The cIMF comprised fat globules with a volume moment mean (De Brouckere Mean Diameter; D[4,3]) of 0.8 µm and a mode diameter 0.5 µm. The eIMF comprised phospholipid-coated (Lipamin M 20, Lecico, France) lipid globules with a D[4,3]) of 7 µm, and a mode diameter 4.2 µm, explained in more detail elsewhere. The eIMF (Nuturis) is defined as a concept infant milk formula with large, phospholipid coated lipid droplets with mode diameter 3–5 μm. IMF powders (283 g/kg feed) were supplemented with protein and carbohydrate (Ssniff Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, Germany) to obtain AIN-93G-compliant diets, with a fat moiety (~ 7 w%) derived entirely from IMF. Calculated nutrient composition of the diets. Calculated nutrient composition (in g/kg) of the diets (given during postnatal day 16–42). Lean and fat mass was quantified by time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (LF90II, Bruker Optics, Billerica, MA, USA), not requiring fasting or anesthesia as described elsewhere. Measurements were done in the same animals at PN28, PN35 and PN41. Mice were anaesthetized (isoflurane/O2) after a 4-h fasting period (during light phase; 9 AM–1 PM) and sacrificed by heart puncture; a terminal blood sample was drawn. Plasma was analyzed using the V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 (mouse) kit (K15048D), Mouse Adiponectin Kit (K152BXC), Mouse Leptin Kit (K152BYC), Mouse MCP-1 Ultra-Sensitive Kit (K152AYC), Mouse/Rat Total Active GLP-1, Insulin, Glucagon Kit (K15171C) and the Mouse/Rat Resistin Kit (K152FNC). Analyses were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Meso Scale Diagnostics LLC, USA). Plasma was analyzed using commercially available kits for triglycerides (Roche, 11877771216), total cholesterol (Roche, 11491458216), free cholesterol (Spinreact, 41035), NEFA (Sopachem, 157819910935), and phospholipids (Sopachem, 157419910930). Esterified cholesterol was calculated as the difference between total and free. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, plasma bile acid species were quantified. To 25 µl of plasma, we added a mixture of internal standards (isotopically labelled bile acids). Samples were centrifuged at 15,800×g and the supernatants were transferred and evaporated at 40 °C under a stream of N2. Samples were reconstituted in 200 µl methanol:water (1:1), mixed and centrifuged at 1800×g for 3 min. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.2 µm spin-filter at 2000×g for 10 min. Filtrates were transferred to vials and 10 µl was injected into the LC–MS system. The LC–MS system consisted of a Nexera X2 Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography system (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan), coupled to a Sciex Qtrap 4500 MD triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA). Data were analyzed with Analyst MD 1.6.2 software. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were quantified using gas chromatography. Cryogenically crushed tissues were homogenized in Potter–Elvehjem tubes in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. A known quantity of homogenized tissue, plasma or food was transferred to glass tubes, and capped with silicone-ptfe septum screw caps. An internal standard (heptadecanoic acid, C17, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added. Lipids were trans-methylated at 90 °C for 4 h in 6 M HCl:methanol (ratio 1:5), liquid–liquid extracted twice using hexane, transferred to a clean tube, dried at 45 °C under a stream of N2, reconstituted in hexane and transferred to GC vials with inserts. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography as previously described. The GC system consisted of 6890N network gas chromatograph (Agilent) and was equipped with a HP- ULTRA 1 (50 m length × 0.2 mm diameter, 0.11 µm film thickness) column. Acylcarnitine species were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To 50 µl liver homogenate, prepared as described above, a mixture of internal standards (isotopically labelled acylcarnitine species) and acetonitrile was added. Samples were mixed and centrifuged (15,000×g) to precipitate proteins. Supernatant was transferred to GC vials. Samples were analyzed using LC–MS/MS as previously described. The LC–MS/MS system consisted of an API 3000 LC–MS/MS equipped with a Turbo ion spray source (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Ontario, Canada). Data were analyzed with Analyst and Chemoview software (Applied Biosystems/MSDSciex). Targeted quantitative proteomics was performed on mitochondrial targets involved in substrate transport, fatty acid oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. We used isotopically labeled concatemers as internal standards designed to target murine mitochondrial proteins. The internal standards were derived from synthetic peptides (PolyQuant GmbH, Bad Abbach, Germany) developed as previously described. The method relies on targeted LC–MS/MS in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode to quantify 55 murine mitochondrial proteins in a single run. This method was optimized in isolated mitochondrial fractions from mouse and rat liver and cultured human fibroblasts and in total liver extracts from mice, rats, and humans. In this study, we used total liver extracts. The targeted proteomics approach is suitable and validated for the quantification of proteins in the mitochondrial energy metabolic pathways in mouse, rat, and human samples. In our proteomics approach, the exact amino acid sequence of the peptides is known, and bona fide reference samples were available to test the performance of the assay in the context of the particular experiment. Targeted LC–MS/MS proteomics is a powerful and superior alternative for immune-based quantitative techniques, when internal controls are available. Quantification of gene expression was performed as previously described. Using TRI-Reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), total RNA was extracted from cryogenically crushed whole livers. RNA was quantified by NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Integrity was confirmed by observing ribosomal bands on 1% agarose in TAE. cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV (Invitrogen, Breda, the Netherlands) and random nonamers (Sigma). cDNA was quantified by relative standard curves using quantitative real-time PCR as previously described. Primer and TaqMan probe sequences are given in Table 4. Primer and TaqMan probe sequences. Statistics were performed using IBM SPSS for Windows, version 23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Time-series are plotted as median and interquartile range. Data are plotted as Tukey box-and-whisker plots and scatter plots. Analyses were carried out on all mice or samples whenever technically feasible and material was available. No data were excluded. Data were not assumed to be normally distributed, so were tested non-parametrically using the exact two-sided Mann Whitney U test. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Figures 1,2,3,4 were rendered using GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, https://www.graphpad.com). Experimental procedures were approved by an external independent animal experiment committee (CCD, Central Animal Experiments Committee, The Netherlands), and after positive advice by the Committee for Animal Experimentation of the University of Groningen. Subsequently, the study design was approved by the local Animal Welfare Body Procedures complied with the principles of good laboratory animal care following the European Directive 2010/63/EU for the use of animals for scientific purposes. This study was not performed blinded as the programming diets were visually distinct. Breeders and female offspring were terminated (CO2) at weaning, in compliance with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals.
