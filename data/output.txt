The holotype (BNHS [Museum of the Bombay Natural History Society] FWF 966) and paratype (BNHS FWF 967) of Aenigmachanna gollum and two additional specimens, 81.8 mm standard length [SL] (KUFOS [Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences] 2019.8.224) and 124.5 mm SL (KUFOS2019.8.225) were scanned with a Zeiss Versa Nano CT scanner. The 124.5 mm specimen was stained in a 5% iodine solution for four days before scanning. Depending on the specimen (stained or unstained) a voltage of 60 to 90 kV was selected to optimize X-ray transmission. A rotation of 360 degrees was used collecting 1601 projections for each scan. Using both geometric and optical magnification (0.4 × lens) techniques along with the vertical stitching function, a final voxel size of 16.6 μm was possible for the holotype and paratype. A similar approach resulted in a voxel size of 15.1 μm for the 124.5 mm (iodine-stained) specimen. With the 81.8 mm specimen we focused on attaining a high pixel resolution of the skull with a 5.7 μm voxel size. Data reconstruction was implemented using the Zeiss Reconstructor Scout-and-Scan software. A filtered back projection algorithm and beam hardening correction was used to reconstruct the projections to produce a stack of 16-bit tiff images. For comparison, a fifth scan of the channid Parachanna obscura (Cornell University Fish Collection CUMV 96491) was downloaded from MorphoSource (https://www.morphosource.org/Detail/MediaDetail/Show/media_id/33518). All 3D rendering was made using the Avizo (2019.1) software package. A median filter was used to reduce image noise to allow for accurate segmentation. Region growing tools such as the magic wand were used to segment individual bones slice by slice. Individual or series of bones were masked to produce the final volume renders. Segmentation of cavities to produce virtual casts was also by region growing on a slice by slice basis. A fifth specimen of Aenigmachanna gollum, 60.6 mm SL (KUFOS 2019.8.226), was cleared and double-stained to complement information obtained from the CT scans. For the morphological analysis we studied cleared and double stained specimens of the following taxa of the order Labyrinthici: Pristolepis fasciata (MTD-F39837), Badis corycaeus (MTD-F39838), Nandus nandus (MTD-F39839), Ctenopoma multispine (MTD-F39840), Sandelia bainsii (MTD-F39841), Belontia hasselti (MTD-F39842), Parachanna africana (MTD-F39824), P. obscura (MTD-F39843), Channa micropeltes (MTD-F39844, MTD-F39845), C. bankanensis (MTD-F39846), C. marulius (MTD-F39847), C. punctata (MTD-F39825), C. gachua (MTD-F39848) and C. bleheri (MTD-F39849), in addition to Aenigmachanna. We scored 46 characters (see Supplementary Files) for the listed 15 taxa and conducted a parsimony analysis of the resulting data matrix using PAUP* v4.0a. A heuristic search with a random-addition sequence (ten replicated) and tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch swapping was conducted to find equally parsimonious trees, using unordered characters and assigning all characters equal weight. Node support was estimated using 1000 bootstrap replicates and character evolution was traced on the resulting phylogenetic trees using the DELTRAN option in PAUP* for selected characters in Fig. 5, but using the DELTRAN and ACCTRAN options for all characters in Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2. To reconstruct the phylogenetic position of Aenigmachanna we assembled two different datasets with distinct taxon and gene sampling: Dataset 1 consisted of 20 Channoidei (1 Aenigmachanna, 17 Channa, and 2 Parachanna species), 22 Anabantoidei representing all genera, and 2 members of the Labyrinthici families Badidae and Nandidae as outgroups. For this data set, the following marker sequences were used: (a) partial 12S and 16S; (b) coxI; (c) cytb; (d) the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 2 (nd2) gene; (e) rag1; and the nuclear SH3 and PX domain-containing 3-like protein gene (sh3px3). The total alignment consisted of 5979 bp. Dataset 2 consisted of 20 Channoidei (1 Aenigmachanna, 17 Channa, and 2 Parachanna species), 6 Anabantoidei representing all 3 families, and 1 member of the Labyrinthici family Nandidae as outgroup. This dataset consisted of the 13 protein coding genes from whole mitochondrial genomes and the final alignment consisted of 11,409 bp. Our two datasets consisted of both newly determined sequences and sequences retrieved from Genbank (Supplementary Tables S1, S2). For the DNA sequences generated in India of the holotype and paratype of Aenigmachanna gollum, the following DNA extraction protocol was used: Gills were harvested from fresh specimen and were preserved in 100% ethanol. DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Five gene fragments were sequenced including four mitochondrial and two nuclear gene fragments: (a) partial mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene, (b) partial mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, (c) partial mitochondrial coxI, (d) complete mitochondrial cytb, (e) rag1, and (f) sh3px3. The nd2 was taken from the whole mt genome sequences (see below). Amplified DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard SV Gel PCR clean-up system (Promega) followed by Sanger sequencing by 1st BASE, Axil Scientific Pte Ltd, Singapore. For the generation of the Aenigmachanna mt genomes DNA was isolated using a salting out protocol. The mt genomes were amplified in their entirety using a long PCR technique as described in. The PCR products were sent to Clevergene Biocorp Pvt Ltd (Bangalore, India) where the library preparation and further procedures were conducted for Illumina sequencing. The amplicons (there were two amplicons one ~ 7000 bp and the second ~ 12,000 bp) were fragmented using Covaris M-220 Focussed Ultrasonicator, to generate 300 bp fragments. These fragments were used for library preparation using NEB Next DNA II Library for Ilumina E7645S, using the manufacturers protocol. The QC passed libraries were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq to generate 2 × 301 paired end reads. The sequence data quality was checked using FastQC and MultiQC software. The data was checked for base call quality distribution, % bases above Q20, Q30, %GC, and sequencing adapter contamination. The sequence data was processed using Trim Galore to remove low quality bases and adapter sequences. The quality trimmed data was checked using FastQC and MultiQC. Quality passed reads were assembled using Higher Hierarchical Genome assembler (HGA). HGA produced three scaffolds with > 1000 bp length. The Norgal assembler was used to generate another assembly. Norgal (de Novo ORGAneLle extractor) is designed to assemble de novo mtDNA genome from de novo genome sequence data. Assembly was made with kmer range of 21–255 with interval of 28. Contig length threshold of 500 bp was set for the assembly. The circular genomes were annotated using MITOS web server. There were 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA and 13 protein coding genes in each mt genome. A detailed analysis and characterization of the mt genome of Aenigmachanna is in preparation. For newly determined sequences other than for Aenigmachanna, the protocols for DNA extraction, PCR primers and PCR conditions and sequencing by LGC Genomics, Berlin follow previous protocols. For the sh3px3, the nested PCR protocol of Li et al. was used. Chromatogram traces/raw reads were edited and assembled into contigs using Geneious v10.2.6 and individual gene by gene datasets were complimented with sequences retrieved from GenBank prior to conducting an alignment with default settings using MAFFT v7.017 as implemented in Geneious v10.2.6. The alignments of the protein coding genes were checked for frameshifts and premature stop codons. The individual gene by gene alignments were concatenated in Geneious v10.2.6 prior to phylogenetic analyses. Details of specimens used, datasets and GenBank accession numbers are given in Supplementary Table S1. The optimal partitioning (for subsequent RAxML, and BEAST analysis of dataset 1) and substitution model scheme (for subsequent BEAST analysis of dataset 1) for the concatenated dataset were generated using PartitionFinder 1.0.1 using initial partitions according to gene and codon position in case of protein coding genes. The setting model_selection = BIC and search = greedy was used for the different PartitionFinder runs (models = raxml and beast (dataset 1 only), respectively). The PartitionFinder results and subsequent partition strategies and models used for the different datasets are shown in Supplementary Table S3. Maximum likelihood analyses was conducted with RAxML v7.3.4, implementing the GTRGAMMA model for all partitions as identified by PartitionFinder under the − f a setting and 1000 bootstrap replicates. The three possible alternative topologies regarding the phylogenetic placement of Aenigmachanna among Channoidei were evaluated employing the approximately unbiased (AU), Kishino–Hasegawa (KH), and Shimodaira–Hasegawa (SH) tests as implemented in CONSEL version 0.1k following. The three alternative topologies were: (Aenigmachanna (Parachanna, Channa)), (Parachanna (Aenigmachanna, Channa)), and (Channa (Aenigmachanna, Parachanna)). Divergence times for dataset 1 were estimated in BEAST v2.4.5 using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock. The Yule process was used as the speciation model and the partitions as defined by PartitionFinder. The options unlink substitution model, unlink clock model, and link all tree models were selected. The following priors were changed from their default value: clock rate (usld.mean) for the three genes were changed to Gamma (1, 1), initial = 1; and all p substitution parameters (GTR substitution parameters) were changed from Gamma to InverseGamma. We used the channid fossil†Parachanna fayumensis from the Jebel Qatrani Formation , Fayum Depression in Egypt , Late Eocene to Oligocene (about 35–33 mya) and the anabantoid fossil Osphronemus from the Sangkarewang Formation in Central Sumatra, a formation dating back to the Early Oligocene to Late Eocene age (28.5–37.0 mya). Following Rüber et al. these two lognormal calibration priors from the fossil record were used: TMRCA Parachanna crown (offset 33.0; 37.0 Mya 95% soft upper bound; log mean = 0.1; log stdev = 0.8) and the TMRCA Osphronemus crown (offset 28.5; 35.0 Mya 95% soft upper bound; log mean = 0.23; log stdev = 1.0). Alternative calibrations were conducted assigning the Parachanna and Osphromenus fossils to their respective stem groups as in. For a discussion on the Channoidei fossil record see. We used both, crown and stem calibrations because fossils are assigned to a branch based on the morphological characters they have. However, for calibrations fossils need to be assigned to a node. As each branch on a tree has two nodes that limit it, we calculated minimum ages for both options assigning it to the crown node and assigning it to the stem node. When the fossil is assigned to the crown node (our crown calibration) the calculated age for a specific lineage will be older than if the fossil is assigned to the stem node (our stem calibration). Calculating both options provides us with a better estimate of the ranges of minimum clade ages. The MCMC chain was run for 100 million iterations sampling every 10,000 steps and a conservative burnin of 20.000 steps. These settings were sufficient to ensure convergence and obtain ESS values > 200.
All methods and supporting data are available within the paper and the Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. Conditional Yap1 allele floxed mice (13) were crossed with knockin mice containing Mer-Cre-Mer (MCM) inserted in the Tcf21 locus (14) (Yap;Tcf21) or transgenic mice harboring tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 driven by the Col1a1 promoter (15) (Yap;Col1a1) to generate conditional YAP-deleted mice. All mouse lines were C57BL/6J background. Age- and sex-matched littermate controls (Yap) were used for all experiments, which were performed blinded to genotype. All protocols concerning the use of animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (New Brunswick, New Jersey). Permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was used to induce MI, as previously described (11). Briefly, the left coronary artery was located, and a suture was passed under the artery. To occlude the artery, a short length of tubing was threaded through the suture ends, and occlusion was affected by placing tension on the suture such that the tube compressed the artery. Ischemia was confirmed by electrocardiography change (ST-segment elevation). For sham operation, the same protocol was followed; however, no ligation of the coronary artery was performed. Chronic AngII/phenylephrine (PE) infusion was attained by using osmotic mini-pumps (Alzet, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, California) that were implanted subcutaneously in 8- to 10-week-old mice under anesthesia (2.5% Avertin, 12 μl/g body weight). AngII (288 μg/kg/day) with PE (100 mg/kg/day) was delivered for 2 weeks as previously described (16). Control groups received vehicle infusion. Primary neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs) and human ventricular fibroblasts were cultured as described elsewhere (7,17). Adenoviral transduction, transfection, luciferase reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, immunostaining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and collagen gel contraction assays were performed using primary cells. All data are reported as mean ± SEM. Evaluation between 3 or more groups was performed by using one-way analysis of variance. Post hoc multiple pairwise comparisons were performed by using Tukey’s test. Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the difference in means between 2 groups. The normality of continuous variables was determined by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Axenic  MED4 cells were grown under constant light flux (30–40 μmol photons m−2 s−1) at 24 °C in natural seawater-based Pro99 medium containing 0.2-µm-filtered Sargasso Sea water, amended with Pro99 nutrients (N, P, and trace metals) prepared as previously described [47]. Growth was monitored using bulk culture fluorescence measured with a 10AU fluorometer (Turner Designs). MED4 cells were grown in Pro99 medium with a Sargasso seawater base, at a light level of 25 μmol photons m−2 s−1. Growth was monitored by measuring bulk chlorophyll fluorescence and was compared to a no-drug control culture. For conjugation via filter mating, we followed the procedure described by Tolonen et al. [54]. Conjugation was performed using E. coli 1100–2 carrying plasmid pRK2 (as the conjugation vector) and pRL153 (kanamycin-resistant), as well as E. coli BW19851 carrying BAC conjugation plasmid pMBD14 [90] (chloramphenicol-resistant) - on receiver strain  8102, and  strains MIT9313 and MED4. As described above, in our hands, the method did not yield any conjugants after incubation of exconjugants for two months. For conjugation via liquid mating, we used the same donor and receiver strains, and the following procedure: 1 ml of log-phase donor E. coli was added to 25 ml of log-phase  or  receiver strain and the co-culture was left to grow overnight. Antibiotic was then directly added to the co-culture at the same concentration used on solid media (kanamycin 50 µg ml−1, chloramphenicol 10 µg ml−1). The addition of nalidixic acid at 50 µg ml−1 was also attempted to remove the E. coli donor strain. Cultures were then grown for 45–60 days but did not yield conjugants. For conjugation via ‘agar stab mating’, we used E. coli donor strain BW20767 carrying plasmids pBAMD1-4-GFP or pBAMD1-4-YFP for mating with  WH8102 and  strains NATL2A and SB. Then 25 ml of log-phase receiver strain was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000  for 15 min at 20 °C and resuspended in 200 µl Pro99 medium. Log phase E. coli donor strain was mixed at a 1 : 1 cell ratio with the receiver strain, and 20 µl of the mixture was injected inside a 1 ml volume of polymerized Pro99 with 1 % agar - the ‘agar stab’ (Fig. S1). After 24 h incubation, cells were sucked out of the agar using a pipet tip, resuspended in liquid Pro99 medium, and plated for selection with 5 µg ml−1 of spectinomycin and streptomycin (combined 1 : 1; plating procedure below). We used plasmid mini-Tn5 pBAMD1-4 [59] to construct transposon tools for insertion into  genomes. Genes encoding the GFPmutII and YFP reporters, shown to fluoresce efficiently in a wide range of cyanobacteria [56] were cloned by Gibson assembly behind the strong  P ccmk promoter for Rubisco protein [91], well conserved in various  and  strains [85]. The pBAMD1-4 plasmid was linearized by digestion with HindIII-HF and EcoRI-HF (New England Biolabs #R3104S and #R3101S) at 37 °C for 2 h in Cutsmart buffer. The GFPmutII-encoding fragment was amplified from plasmid pCV0001 DNA using primers RL017 and RL018; the YFP-encoding fragment was amplified from plasmid pCV0021 using primers RL020 and RL021. The P ccmk promoter was amplified from  MED4 genomic DNA using primers RL015 and RL016 for the P ccmk-gfpmutII construct, and RL015 and RL019 for the P ccmk-yfp construct. The three-part assembly reaction (plasmid-promoter-insert) was performed using the Gibson assembly master mix 2x (New England Biolabs #E2611S), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The mixture was transformed in One Shot PIR1 Chemically Competent E. coli (Thermofisher #C101010). For the construction of pBAMD1-4-Pccmk (comprising the P ccmk promoter inserted within the transposon in front of the antibiotic resistance aadA gene, but no fluorescent marker gene) P ccmk was amplified from  MED4 genomic DNA using primers RL121 and RL122, which contain EcoRI and SwaI restriction sites, respectively. Both pBAMD1-4 and the insert were digested with EcoRI-HF and SwaI-HF (New England Biolabs #R0604S and # R3101S), ligated, and transformed in PIR1 E. coli as described above. For each sample labelled, 100 µl of culture were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 900 µl of filtered Pro99 medium. Then 1 µl of reconstituted LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the 1 ml cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000  for 5 min at 20 °C and resuspended in 0.5 ml of fresh Pro99. Samples were then serially diluted and immediately run on the flow cytometer. A positive control (untreated exponentially growing cell culture) and negative control (1 ml of cells from the same culture heated to 80 °C for 5 min) were included with each run to gate the live and dead cell populations. Cell abundances, viability (Live/Dead violet staining and chlorophyll fluorescence), and fluorescein-labelled oligonucleotide delivery were measured on a Guava easyCyte 12HT flow cytometer (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cells were excited with a blue 488 nm laser for measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (692/40 nm), size (forward scatter) and fluorescein fluorescence (525/30 nm); and with a violet 405 nm laser to measure the violet dead stain fluorescence (448/50 nm). All flow cytometry files were analysed using FlowJo software version 7.6.5 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR, USA) and the following workflow: (1)  cells were counted by a defined gate on the red fluorescence (chlorophyll) versus forward scatter (size) plot. (2) From these selected events, viable cells were counted by a defined threshold on the blue fluorescence (violet dead cell stain). The threshold was adjusted for each run using the positive (untreated cells) and negative (heat-shocked cells) control. (3) From the ‘viable cell’ subset of events, the cells into which DNA was delivered were counted by a defined threshold on the green fluorescence (fluorescein-labelled oligonucleotides). The threshold was adjusted so that <1 % of events from the negative control (cells that did not enter into contact with the oligonucleotides) were included. The dead cell control comprised cells killed by heat treatment at 80 °C for 5 min. The flow cytometry plots were generated using FlowJo. For each osmoprotectant tested, 2 ml of triplicate exponentially growing MED4 culture were harvested by centrifugation at 13 000  for 10 min. Under sterile conditions, pellets were resuspended by gently pipetting up and down in a volume of 100 µl of either solutions 10 % (v/v) glycerol in water; 18.2 % (w/v) sorbitol in water (1M); 5 % (w/v) PEG8000 in water; Pro99 medium (positive control); or MilliQ water (negative control). The washing was repeated once before cells were centrifuged again, resuspended into 1 ml of Pro99 medium, and inoculated in 5 ml of Pro99. The tubes were placed back in the incubator, and recovery was monitored by measuring bulk culture fluorescence. Of note, all osmoprotectant solutions were filter sterilized through 0.2 µm supor membrane filters. Cultures that recovered were checked for the presence of heterotrophic contamination using purity broths, as previously described [47] to ensure that recovery was not facilitated by a contaminating heterotrophic partner [74]. Exponentially growing cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 7000  for 15 min at 20 °C. Then 50 ml culture pellets were washed three times in 5 ml (1 M sorbitol solution) by centrifugation at 5000  for 8 min at 20 °C. The final resuspension volume was calculated so that cells were concentrated 1000 times compared to the initial culture volume. Then 500 ng of 90 bp fluorescein-labelled oligonucleotides (sequence: cctcataacaagcagcgctcatagtattaggaatatcgtgaaattcaagatctaagaatatttttttatttaaatttttcaaaattttta) were added to 50 µl of the washed cells and electroporated in 2 mm gap cuvettes at variable electric fields and time constants while keeping the capacitance and resistance fixed at 25 µF and 200 ohms. One ml of fresh Pro99 medium at room temperature was immediately added to the cuvette, and cells were transferred to a culture tube containing 4 ml Pro99 supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 5 mM pyruvate for recovery. Samples were then directly stained with Live/Dead violet and analysed by flow cytometry. We initially tried to deliver a fluorescently labelled pUC19 plasmid (using the fluorescein LabelIT Tracker kit, MirusBio), but the signal to noise ratio was not sufficient to detect the plasmid. For transposome delivery, 2 µl of EZ-Tn5 (Lucigen) in vitro-assembled transposomes were added to the 50 µl cell suspension in sorbitol before electroporation. Addition of DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Millipore Sigma) and Type One Inhibitor (Lucigen), following the manufacturer’s instructions, were also attempted, as they were shown to favour successful transposome transformation in the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis C1 [92, 93]. After transposome delivery, cells were left to recover for 24 h before plating. To obtain single colonies from an axenic culture, serial dilutions of an exponentially growing cyanobacterial culture grown in Pro99 medium (as described above) were pour-plated in the plating medium (Pro99 medium supplemented with 0.05 % (wt/vol) Pyruvate and 3.75 mM TAPS (pH 8) and containing 0.3 % low melting point (LMP) agarose. To prepare the plating medium, we first sterilized a 3 % LMP agar solution in ultrapure water independently by three rounds of boiling in a microwave (~20 s each, to avoid boiling-over and loss of volume). We then added the melted LMP agar 1 : 10 in the Pro99 medium base supplemented with pyruvate and TAPS. The mixture was maintained at ~28 °C in a water bath to cool before plating. Of importance, the LMP agarose was microwave sterilized and not autoclaved to avoid creating reactive oxygen species likely to inhibit  growth [76]. Microwave-based boiling was sufficient to prevent the appearance of contaminants in the nutrient-poor Pro99 medium. For antibiotic selection after transposome delivery, 1 ml of ‘recovering’ cells (post electroporation, see above) were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 µl of fresh Pro99, and pour plated in 10 ml plating medium supplemented with the antibiotic. Kanamycin was used at 50 µg ml−1, and aminoglycoside resistance (encoded by aadA) selected with a combination of streptomycin and spectinomycin at 5 µg ml−1 total concentration (2.5 µg ml−1 each). Individual colonies typically became visible after 40–60 days. They were picked using a sterile pipet tip and inoculated into 5 ml of fresh Pro99 medium. The efficiency of colony formation from a diluted culture is variable and generally low (~1 %), an effect that seems alleviated by plating a higher number of cells, as an axenic lawn of cells would grow significantly faster, typically visible after 15–30 days. The chloramphenicol resistance gene cat and the spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance gene aadA were codon-optimized for  using the codon usage table from the Kazusa database, and the OPTIMIZER online tool [94]. The codon-optimized sequence, which is preceded by the P ccmk promoter and flanked by the Tn5 mosaic end, and were synthesized through the Genscript gene synthesis service (see sequence in supplementary data). Transposome DNA containing the antibiotic resistance cassette and the mosaic ends were amplified using the template plasmids and primers (all 5′ phosphorylated) listed in Table 2: Strains, plasmids and primers. Antibiotic markers: ApR, ampicillin; CmR, chloramphenicol; GmR, gentamicin; KmR, kanamycin; SmR, streptomycin; SpR, spectinomycin; and TetR, tetracycline

 This work Transposome T1 amplified using RL005 and RL006 primers from pCV0001 template DNA Transposome T2 amplified using RL007 and RL008 primers from pCV0021 template DNA Transposome T3 amplified using RL079 and RL080 primers from pBAMD1-4-GFP template DNA Transposome T4 amplified using RL079 and RL080 primers from pBAMD1-4-YFP template DNA Transposome T5 amplified using RL081 and RL080 primers from the synthesized codon-optimized chloramphenicol resistance cassette template DNA Transposome T7 amplified using RL079 and RL080 primers from the pBAMD1-4-Pccmk template DNA Transposome T8 amplified using RL140 and RL080 primers from the synthesized codon-optimized Spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance cassette template DNA. PCR mixtures were digested for 1 h at 37 °C with DpnI (New England Biolabs) to remove the template plasmids. PCR products were then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), eluted in TE buffer at pH 7.5, and DNA purity was assessed using a NanoDrop ND8000 spectrophotometer. Using the same kit, samples were often purified a second time to remove detectable impurities. Transposomes were formed using the EZ-Tn5 Transposase (Lucigen) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Then 4 µl of EZ-Tn5 transposase preparation was mixed with 2 µl of transposon DNA at 100 µg µl−1 plus 2 µl of 100 % glycerol and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The transposomes were either electroporated immediately or frozen at −20 °C for later use. The commercial transposome R6Kγori/KAN-2 from Lucigen kit #TSM08KR was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Patients presenting to the dermatology clinic or those evaluated by the inpatient dermatology service between December 2018 and June 2019 were recruited to participate in the study. The inclusion criteria included HSCT patients aged ≥18 years at the time of consent with a rash covering at least 5% body surface area (BSA) and suspected of having acute cutaneous GVHD. The main exclusion criteria were a lack of unequivocal histopathologic findings supporting a diagnosis of acute GVHD or clinical progression of symptoms that favored an alternate diagnosis. After obtaining informed consent, three 4-mm punch biopsies were collected from each patient, two from lesional and one from unaffected skin. In one case, a shave biopsy was taken from lesional skin. One of the lesional skin specimens was placed in formalin for routine hematoxylin and eosin processing and diagnostic reading by a dermatopathologist (B.H.) to confirm the clinical suspicion of acute GVHD. The two research samples (one lesional and one control/unaffected) were stored on saline-soaked gauze until further processing, as detailed later. Representative sites were chosen by the clinical appearance of rash (e.g. presence of erythema, edema, papules on lesional skin) or lack thereof in the case of the control specimens. Skin biopsy samples were processed within 4 hours of sample collection in an overnight digestion in dissociation media (RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, 1 mg/mL collagenase, 2 mM L-glu, penicillin 100 U/mL, and streptomycin 100 μg/mL) at 37 °C to create a single cell suspension. The next morning, DNAse was added to a final concentration of 200 U/mL, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were mechanically disrupted and then iteratively washed through a series of filters (100 μm, 70 μm) using ice cold HBSS with EDTA. After each wash, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 RPM. After the final round of washing, cells were counted using trypan blue and a manual hemocytometer. Finally, cells were resuspended in 70% DMSO with FCS for storage at −80 °C while awaiting further analysis. Once five patient samples from lesional and unaffected skin were collected, the samples were thawed, washed, and resuspended prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Antibodies were used to identify macrophages (CD14, HCD14), lymphocytes (CD3, HIT3a), and lymphocyte subtypes (CD4 OKT4, CD8 HIT8a; Biolegend, San Diego, CA). The samples were analyzed using BDFACSCanto or LSR II instruments with FACSDiva software, and data were analyzed using FlowJo, version 10, along with Prism software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Statistical analysis was performed in Prism using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test.
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is an open database containing millions of biological samples from functional genomics experiments. The Search Tag Analyze Resource for GEO (STARGEO) platform allows for meta-analysis of genomic signatures between normal and diseased tissue through tagging of biological samples from public experiments. More information on STARGEO and can be found in our previous paper [32]. We conducted two meta-analyses on adult human skin (60 DM vs 34 healthy) and muscle biopsy (71 DM vs 22 healthy) samples. DM here is defined by clinical and histopathological criteria [33, 34, 35, 36]. Briefly, to be diagnosed with definitive DM patients had to meet inclusion criteria of onset after 18 and an insidious or subacute onset, pattern of weakness (symmetric proximal > distal and neck flexor > extensor), and rashes typical of DM including Gottron's sign, V-sign, shawl sign, and heliotrope periorbital edema. Patients had to also demonstrate elevated serum creatinine kinase and electromyography consistent with DM. Electromyography had to display motor unit action potential (MUAP) durations that were short in duration, polyphasic, and small in amplitude. Increased spontaneous activity also had to be seen in the form of fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves. Lastly, muscle biopsies had to include the following features: endomysial T cell infiltrates surrounding and invading non-necrotic fibers, perifascicular atrophy, perivascular and perimysial inflammatory cell infiltrate, MAC depositions on small blood vessels or reduced capillary density, and endomysial CD8 T cells surrounding non-necrotic fibers. DM muscle samples were taken from series GSE1551, GSE 3307, and GSE48280 and DM skin samples were taken from series GSE32245 and GSE46239. As these studies do not define DM subtypes nor provide myositis-specific autoantibody presence, we combined samples across studies to elucidate general mechanisms of pathogenesis [14, 16, 37, 38, 39]. Meta-analysis was also conducted in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) blood (114 RA vs 90 healthy; samples taken from series GSE15573 and GSE17755) and synovial fluid (130 RA vs 68 healthy; samples taken from series GSE12021, GSE13026, GSE1919, GSE2053, GSE21959, GSE29746, GSE55235, GSE55457, and GSE77298), sarcoidosis (SD) bronchoalveolar lavage (21 SD vs 20 healthy; samples taken from series GSE75023 and GSE110779) and peripheral blood (216 SD vs 271 healthy; samples taken from GSE18781, GSE1907, GSE19314, GSE37912, GSE42825, GSE42826, GSE42830, GSE42832, and GSE83456), systemic sclerosis (SSc) skin (63 SSc vs 31 healthy; samples taken from GSE12493 and GSE9285), and Kawasaki (KA) peripheral blood (121 KA vs 40 healthy; samples taken from GSE18606, GSE68004, and GSE109351) for comparative TRIM activity analysis. We were able to extract large number of genes for each of the meta-analyses conducted using STARGEO (see Table 1). We analyzed gene signature outputs with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), restricting genes showing statistical significance (p < 0.05) and an absolute experimental log ratio greater than 0.1 between case and control samples. A total of 1,392 and 461 genes from DM muscle and skin analysis, respectively, were included in the IPA analysis. These selected genes were used for the next step analysis in IPA to elucidate biological process, disease mechanisms, and potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that will be highlighted in the results and discussion sections. Table 1 details top up and downregulated genes for the DM skin and muscle analyses. See supplemental tables 1 and 2 for a complete list of gene p-values and experimental log ratios. Summary of the top up and down-regulated genes from the meta-analysis of muscle and skin samples from dermatomyositis patients. Experimental log ratios indicating magnitude of change from control samples are shown. IPA allows for robust analysis of omics data using current knowledge of disease processes, biological pathways, and activity of existing drugs. The relationship between genes, disease processes, phenotype, and drug activity can be searched for and highlighted in inputted genetic studies. IPA contains a myriad of facts from genomic experiments of many modalities and allows us to dissect complex biological networks that characterize genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data [40]. IPA enables us to take full advantage of our approach's novel use of large-scale data, and results from IPA analysis are demonstrated in this paper. All data analyzed were taken from Gene Expression Omnibus [41, 42]. There was no interaction or intervention with human subjects and no involvement with access to identifiable private patient information. As such, no IRB approval was necessary.
A Medline-based literature search of peer-reviewed articles addressing CaP, CRPC, and AR was performed. For reviewing AR-negativity (Table 2), search results were narrowed based on the terms “prostate cancer” and “androgen receptor” and “IHC” to specifically interrogate AR protein expression. An additional criterion included filtering results for species specification (human). Of the 42 results on PubMed, 22 were included in Table 1 due to exclusion of studies that (1) were cell-line based, (2) did not explicitly quantify AR positivity or negativity in their analyses, or (3) did not show data for AR protein expression. For some studies, AR positivity was quantified as a percentage of total specimens stained; these cases were included in Table 1 after calculating AR negativity as the remainder of samples that were not considered “AR positive”. Median survival after treatment with second generation anti-androgens. Survival is represented as survival benefit over control for each study and was measured in median months (mos) of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (POS) or metastasis free survival (MFS). * indicates values represented as raw median survival without normalization to placebo, as discussed in the primary source. Prevalence of AR low/negative Expression Pattern in CaP and CRPC. Quantification and scoring of AR in prostate cancer (CaP), metastases (Mets), and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) showing the prevalence of AR low/negative expression pattern (noted either directly or by exclusion from AR positivity quantification). Each study has been listed by author, followed by year of publication, disease stage analyzed (CaP, Mets, CRPC), prevalence of AR low/- samples quantified as a percent of total samples, sample size (n), and the AR antibody used in the study. Tissues were acquired from the Prostate Cancer Biorepository Network (PCBN), through Dr. Colm Morrissey at the University of Washington. This LuCaP patient derived xenograft tissue array includes CRPC subtypes AR+ (LuCaP23.1, 35, 77, 76CR, 73; n = 45 cores), AR low/- (DNPC – LuCaP173.2A, 173.2B, ARLPC – LuCaP176; n = 27 cores), and NEPC (LuCaP173.1, 145.1, 145.2, 93; n = 36 cores). IHC was performed according to Biocare protocol, as previously described. Briefly, tissues were hydrated using xylenes and ethanol, and primary antibody detecting the C-terminus of AR (Abcam Cat. No. 227678, Cambridge, UK) was incubated on tissue for 1 h at room temperature. AR expression was detected with Immpact Vector Red substrate (Vector Laboratories Cat. No. 5105, Burlingame, CA, USA), and nuclei were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Millipore Sigma Cat. No. MHS16, St. Louis, MO, USA). Single stained slides were used to create a spectral library and the array was imaged using Vectra automatic image acquisition (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Objective quantification was determined using InForm version 1.4 software (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described.[7], [8] Graphpad Prism 5.04 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Differences among continuous variables were assessed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test. For all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, denoted with *.

Patients (101 individuals) above 18 years old with chronic HCV infection, genotypes 1a or 1b, attending the Hepatology Service at the Federal University Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho (HUCFF), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were selected for this work. These patients were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C, confirmed by histopathology and serum HCV RNA detection by PCR. We excluded pregnant or nursing women; patients using immunosuppressants or antineoplastic therapy; and patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Patients were treated for 48 weeks with PEG-IFN α2b (1,5 μg/kg once weekly) and RBV (1000–1200 mg/day); or IFN α2b (3 million units 3 times/week) and RBV (750–1000 mg/day). Patients were classified as responders (serum viral levels not detected at the end of treatment and sustained for additional 24 weeks); relapses (serum viral levels not detected at the end of treatment and detected after 24 weeks); and non-responders (serum viral levels detected throughout treatment). A total of 109 patients with a minimum medical follow-up of 6 years were selected, allowing us to monitor the evolution of liver disease. Clinical data were compiled using the SPSS 14.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences v.14.0) program based on medical records. Outcome and treatment response in this cohort have been previously described [10,11]. This work has been approved by the HUCFF Research Ethics Committee (CEP) and registered with CIC under the numbers: CEP- 166/05 and CIC 148/05. The stage of liver fibrosis was assessed by biopsy or transient elastography (Fibroscan®) according to medical records. All patients were submitted to liver biopsy during staging of liver disease, Fibroscan was used during the follow-up. The severity of fibrosis was classified according to the Metavir score as: mild/moderate (F1– F2) and advanced (F3–F4); F4 indicatet liver cirrhosis [12]. The development of HCC was evaluated using medical records when a hypervascular nodule with washout was detected by Computer Tomography or magnetic resonance. Based on liver disease staging, a total of 8 patients were selected in a paired manner: 4 patients in the mild/moderate fibrosis group, and 4 patients in the cirrhosis group. Serum from patients at baseline, pre-treatment, were previously collected and frozen at −70 °C. Total RNA, including miRNAs, was isolated from 200 μl of serum using silica column filtration, using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit isolation kit (Qiagen, Germany). After extraction, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of RNAs were performed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) and the Eukaryote Total RNA Pico kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Library preparation for sequencing was performed using the Total Ion RNA-Seq kit v2, the Ion Xpress RNA - Seq Barcode 01–16 kit, and the Magnetic Bead Clean Up Module (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, EUA). Quantification and size distribution of library fragments were evaluated using a Bioanalyzer and the DNA 1000 kit. Clonal amplification was performed on an Ion OneTouch ™ 2 System equipment (Thermo Fisher) with Ion PI ™ Hi-Q ™ OT2 200 Kit reagents (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, EUA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed simultaneously for all samples by semiconductor sequencing using the Ion PI ™ Hi - Q ™ Sequencing 200 Kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, EUA) on Ion Proton High Power Sequencer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, EUA) on chip PI v2. The first stage of analysis was performed by the Torrent Suite software package (Thermo Fisher). After base calling, sequences smaller than 8 bp were discarded. The sequences were exported in FASTQ format for further analysis using the CLC Genomics Workbench software, version 8.5 (QIAGEN). The transcripts were trimmed - so that only those between 15 bp and 30 bp in size were kept, compatible with mature miRNAs-, and then annotated by comparing sequence similarity to miRBASE (http://www,mirbase,org). After identification of mature miRNAs, differential expression analysis of miRNAs between the mild fibrosis and cirrhosis groups was performed using Empirical Analysis of Differential Gene Expression (EDGE) [13], considering significant transcripts that varied at least twice (fold-change ≥ 2 and ≤ −2), with p value ≤ 0.05, present in at least two of the samples from each sample group. To verify the potential target genes regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs identified between the two groups studied, the miRnet tool version 2.0 [14] was applied to identify the regulatory networks in which the miRNAs are involved.

        rRNA depletion and RNA-seq
       Harvested worms were washed with M9 medium and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The worm pellets were lysed by QIAzol (Qiagen, Cat: 79306) as previously described (McJunkin and Ambros, 2017). ASOs and total RNA were mixed with approximate 2:1 molar ratio (the quantity of ASOs calculated assuming rRNAs comprise > 90% of total RNA). Higher molar ratios of up to 6.5:1 were tested but did not result in observable improvement in depletion efficacy. Accordingly, a mixture containing final concentrations of 0.1 mM of each ASO, 50 ng/µl total RNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.8 U/µl RNase Inhibitor (NEB, Cat:M0314) was incubated at 95 °C for 2 min for denaturation and then 65 °C for 30 min for annealing. We have also tested annealing conditions with gradual decrease in temperature (0.5-2 °C per minute) but no apparent improvement in depletion efficacy was observed. To digest the rRNA, thermostable RNase H and the buffer (MCLAB, Cat:HTRH-100) were preheated to 65 °C and added to the reaction (while maintaining the reaction at 65 °C) to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 U/µl RNase H and the reaction was further incubated at 65 °C for 40 min, and then chilled on ice. Other digestion temperatures from 30 to 85 °C were also tested, and 65 °C was determined to be optimal for reducing rRNA secondary structure without compromising overall RNA integrity of the samples. To digest the ASOs, Turbo DNase (Invitrogen, Cat:AM2238) and the buffer were added to a final concentration of 0.1 U/µl and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. mRNA was then purified by RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Kit (ZYMO, Cat:R1015) as described in (Zhang et al., 2012). The RNA-seq libraries were constructed by NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit (NEB, Cat:E7775, E7335, E7500) and sequenced by Illumina NextSeq 500 system. 
        Data analysis
       Adaptor sequences were trimmed and reads shorter than 15 nt were filtered out from analysis by Cutadapt/1.4.1 (Martin, 2011). For the analysis shown in Fig. 1F,the srpR reads were removed by initially mapping with Bowtie2/2.3.4.3 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), and either total filtered reads (Fig. 1E) or the remaining reads after srpR removal (Fig. 1F) were mapped to C. elegans genome (WBcel235) by Star/2.5.3 with default parameters (Dobin et al., 2013). Mapping data was sorted and processed by Samtools/1.9 (Li et al., 2009). Gene counting was performed using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014).

        Strains
       Animals were grown at 20°C on modified nematode growth media (NGMA) containing 1% agar and 0.7% agarose to prevent burrowing and fed OP50 (Andersen  2014). The cdr-6 deletion strains are described below. All strains are available upon request. [N2 background] [N2 background] [CB4856 background] [CB4856 background] 
        Expression QTL mapping
       Microarray expression for 14,107 probes were previously collected from 208 RIAILs (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009; Rockman  2010), filtered (Andersen  2014), and mapped using linkage mapping with 13,003 SNPs (Brady  2019; Evans and Andersen 2020). The probe that measures expression for cdr-6 is A_12_P101644. All expression and eQTL data can be found in Evans and Anderson, 2020. 
        Generation of 
       Deletion alleles for cdr-6 were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing as previously described (Hahnel  2018; Brady  2019). Briefly, 5’ and 3’ guide RNAs (Synthego, Redwood City, CA) were designed with the highest possible on-target and off-target scores (Doench  2016). The CRISPR injection mix (1 µM dpy-10 sgRNA, 5 µM of each sgRNA for cdr-6, 0.5 µM of a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide template for homology-directed repair of dpy-10 (IDT, Skokie, IL), and 5 µM Cas9 protein (Q3B Berkeley, Berkeley, CA) in water) was assembled and incubated for an hour before injection. Young adults were mounted onto agar injection pads, injected in either the anterior or posterior arm of the gonad, and allowed to recover on 6 cm plates. Survivors were transferred to individual 6 cm plates 12 hours later and allowed to lay embryos. After two to three days, the F1 progeny were screened and individuals with Rol or Dpy phenotypes were selected and transferred to new 6 cm plates. After 48 hours, the F1 individuals were genotyped by PCR flanking the desired deletions. Individuals with deletions were propagated and genotyped for at least two additional generations to ensure homozygosity and to cross out the Rol mutation. Deletion amplicons were Sanger sequenced to identify the exact location of the deletion. Reagents used to generate and validate the deletion are found below: crECA36 dpy-10 guide RNA: GCUACCAUAGGCACCACGAG crECA37 dpy-10 repair construct: CACTTGAACTTCAATACGGCAAGATGAGAATGACTGGAAACCGTACCGCATGCGGTGCCTA GGTAGCGGAGCTTCACATGGCTTCAGACCAACAGCCTAT cdr-6 guide RNA: crECA153: TCCAGTGACAACAACCCTAG crECA115: AGTTTATAGTCGTTGTGTTG External primers for deletion validation: oECA1635: ACACACGTTCACTGGCTAGACT oECA1636: AGCACGTCGTTGATATGCGAAC Internal primers for deletion validation: oECA1365: ACACACGTTCACTGGCTAGACT oECA1637: TGTGTTCCCCATTGAGCTCGAT 
        High-throughput zinc-response assay
       Zinc response was measured as a function of animal optical density (representing nematode development) as described previously (Brady  2019; Evans and Andersen 2020). Briefly, strains were propagated for two generations, bleach-synchronized, and titered in K medium (Boyd  2012) at a concentration of 25-50 embryos per well of a 96-well microtiter plate. The following day, arrested L1s were fed HB101 bacterial lysate (Pennsylvania State University Shared Fermentation Facility, State College, PA; (García-González  2017)) at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL with either 1% water or 250 µM zinc in 1% water. Nematodes were allowed to grow at 20°C with constant shaking for 48 hours, treated with sodium azide (5 mM in water), and analyzed using the COPAS BIOSORT (Union Biometrica; Holliston, MA). Animal optical densities collected by the BIOSORT were processed and analyzed using the R package easysorter (Shimko and Andersen 2014) as described previously (Brady  2019). Each strain has a minimum of 20 replicates and each replicate is defined by the median animal optical densities of six to 32 animals. Pairwise tests for statistically significant differences in the zinc response between strains were performed using the TukeyHSD function (R Core Team 2017) on an ANOVA model with the formula (phenotype ~ strain). For plotting purposes, these residual values were normalized from zero to one with zero being the well with the smallest value and one the well with the largest value.
Construction of the pSpET vector A total of 50 µM of oligo DNA fragments, UM_5′Xba1_shot47 (5′-CTAGAGGTATATTGGCGCCTTCGTGGAATGTCAGTGCCT-3′) and UM_3′Xba1_shot47 (5′-CTAGAGGCACTGACATTCCACGAAGGCGCCAATATACCT-3′), were mixed in 10 µL of TE (10 mM Tric-HCl pH8.0 and 1 mM EDTA pH8.0). Then, the oligo fragments were heated at 95°C using a thermal cycler. After 5 min, the thermal cycler was turned off, and the fragments were left overnight to reach room temperature. The pET21 vector was treated with XbaI restriction enzyme at 37°C for 1 h. After ethanol precipitation, the digested pET21 and shot47 dsDNA fragments were ligated using a DNA ligation kit <Mighty mix> (TAKARA Bio, Shiga, Japan) at 16°C for 30 min. Expression and purification of the Hishot complex The coding sequence (CDS) of GL1 (At3g27920) was amplified with MU_pET_GL1_F (5′-AATGGGTCGCGGATCCGAAATGAGAATAAGGAGAAGAGATG-3′) and MU_pET_GL1_R (5′-TGTCGACGGAGCTCGAATTAAGGCAGTACTCAACATCACC-3′). The amplified GL1 CDS fragment was inserted into pSpET using HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB, NEB, Ipswich, MA). The pSpET-GL1 was transformed into Escherichia coli Rozetta2 (DE3). E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) carrying pSpET-GL1 was inoculated into 10 mL of LB-ampicillin and followed by shaking at 37°C overnight. A total of 10 mL of overnight culture was transferred into 100 mL of LB-ampicillin in a 500-mL flask and shaken at 37°C until the OD600 reached 0.6. Once the culture reached OD600 = 0.6, 1 mM of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the culture was further shaken at 20°C for 20 h to complete induction. Expression and purification of host proteins The DNA fragments of PAP1 (At1g56650) and GL3 (At5g41315) were cleaved by EcoRI and cloned into a shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pGEX6P-1 vector using HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA) to construct GST-PAP1 and GST-GL3, respectively. Then, each construct was transformed to E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3). The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (Umeyama and Morohashi, 2020). Then, GST-fuzed proteins were purified using glutathione sepharose beads based on the manufacturer’s protocol. Finally, the protein concentration was measured with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 100 µL of the 36.6 µM concentration of proteins was used for further analysis. Preparation of Hishot protein The induced culture was collected in a 500-mL bottle followed by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 15 min at 4°C After discarding the supernatant, 30 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1,370 mM NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 81 mM Na2HPO4·12H2O, and 14.7 mM KH2PO4) was added, resuspended, and centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Association of the Hishot complex with the host protein Lysozyme was added in 10 mL of the bacteria-expressed GL1-Hishot protein to achieve 1 mg/mL as a final concentration. In the case of the RNase or RNase inhibitor treatment, RNase I was added to achieve 10 ng/mL as a final concentration, or RNase inhibitor (SUPERase In; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added to achieve 0.8 U/µL as a final concentration, respectively. Then, the reaction solution was incubated for 30 min at 37°C followed by sonication on ice until the stickiness was gone. The sonicated solution was centrifuged at 9,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Then, 500 µL of the supernatant was transferred into a tube that contained 100 µL of the host protein. Next, 300 µL of a 30% slurry of glutathione sepharose 4B was added in the tube and incubated at 4°C with rotation overnight. RNA extraction from the Hishot complex and reverse transcription The reaction extract containing GL1-Hishot proteins and GST proteins was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. Then, the beads were washed three times with 500 μL of PBS. Next, 350 μL of TRI Reagent (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) was added into the beads. The upper layer was transferred into a new tube, and RNase-free DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to achieve 0.1 U/µL as a final concentration. Then, the RNA was purified by phenol–chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The purified RNA was subject to reverse transcription using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo, New York, NY) in a 20-µL reaction volume according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR For semi-qRT-PCR, MU_GL1_seq (5′-GTTCATCACTGCCGCCACAC-3′) and T7 terminator primer (5’-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3’) primer sets were used. After, 25, 30, and 35 cycles of PCR, the reaction was subjected to electrophoresis with 2% agarose gels. For qRT-PCR, the primer sets of YT_GL1_qrt_F (5′-CCGCCACACCTTCTTCTTGTCATC-3′) and YT_GL1_qrt_R (5′-ATACGACGCCGTTAAAGCTCTTGG-3′) were used.
To investigate the role of light in adventitious root initiation (ARI) in Norway spruce, we used de-rooted Norway spruce seedlings as a model system. Three-week-old seedlings grown under white light condition were harvested and de-rooted as described in Materials and
Methods (
). They were first kept in hormone free (HF) distilled water, under three different white light (WL) regimes as described in Materials and
Methods (irradiance 69 to 75 µM/m2/s−1; 
). In these conditions no AR developed at the base of the hypocotyls regardless of the photoperiod or the source of white light. Since we obtained the same results in all WL conditions, we continued to use constant WL (cWL) provided by LEDs (
) as control conditions for the rest of the study.
