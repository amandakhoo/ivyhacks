## API's

Ideally a user would provide a query of the type of experiment they're
interested in, and we could scrape relevant papers as necessary.
This details the API's that we are interested in trying.

### Google Scholar API

Has 3rd party API, nothing official.

### Pubmed API

Second choice if we can't scrape google scholar.
